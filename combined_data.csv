 There are two underlying societal problems showing here, one is the belief that rape doesn't count if the victim is a man or young boy because men want sex all the time so getting raped is them ""getting lucky"". 

 And the second one is the belief that there's no such thing as female pedophile. Or that a female pedophile is less harmful and not predatory like male pedophiles. Basically they see this act as a one time thing which is why she has custody of a male child because it didn't even once cross their minds that she'll just do the same to her son.

389,,"I worked in skin cancer surgery for over 3 years and the thread title comes off as clickbait to me.

Someone looking at the title might think it’s a cancerous lesion deep within the chest cavity when in reality, it’s on the surface. And when people hear “cancer”, they may think something extremely serious like breast cancer which is fatal.

An overwhelming majority of skin cancers if left alone will not be the reason you die. In fact, we often see patients who are old (which is 99% of them btw) decline surgery. You could die WITH the skin cancer but it is not going to be the cause of your death. People find the recovery process more difficult than the actual skin cancer.

In short, wear your sun screen and don’t do tanning beds. Older generations did not have the same etiquette we did when it comes to protecting skin and tanning booths used to be all the rage. And as you’re older, get annual skin exams so they can catch said skin cancers early as the earlier you catch it the less invasive the procedure will be.

Edit: I forgot to mention this but the article specially mentions the lesion was removed entirely during the actual physical. This means Biden did not have to have the more invasive Mohs surgery and it was likely a superficial cancer that was cleared after 1 visit.

Article says they were sanitizing the pump parts (although sometimes re-assembled moist) but still ended up contaminated with cronobacter.
",neu,neg
501,,"The infant was premature and if I'm reading correctly, being fed at least partially through a g-tube. That changes the risk level and baby's ability to fight infection *substantially*. I'm not sure what kind of pump it was to be completely disassembled or if that's just wording of the article and it was a closed system which is safer. 

I get that people are going to harp on this family for the sanitation aspect and I just want to add context. This was a preemie with special feeding needs - likely parents with limited to no paid time off to care for this child - and what they did have was likely burned up while the baby was still in the NICU. Dad is probably back at work and the bulk of the work falling on mom.  If she is pumping, pending baby's age, she could be doing that every two hours. Sanitization takes time and recommendations vary. I'm not sure what their NICU team advised but hot, soapy water for the flanges, duckbills, backflow protectors, and bottles is generally safe. Some recommend running through the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle. Now I said mom may be pumping every two hours. That's 24 hours a day. And the setup and time to pump is about 30 minutes. Now she needs to clean. If she washes by hand that's another 10 minutes  + air dry time. If it's by dishwasher - that's much longer. By the time you are done pumping you're not that far off from the next scheduled pump. If you have multiple sets of parts for your pump, that helps but it's money you may not have. Or maybe during your 2am pump you realized you didn't wash your 12am parts and so you hurriedly wash them, sanitize them and try to dry with a towel but are still a bit damp as you reassemble and pump so you can try to get some sleep before you are up again at 4. Or maybe mom is back at work too and having to store parts in the fridge between pumps. And no where to lay out the tubing to get air in between pumps.

The additional help they brought in had no experience doing the job, but they were offered $7 more an hour as an incentive to work, because HCA is also one of the lowest paying companies in the field. When I learned that all of my co-workers, that I was training, we're being paid significantly more than I was, I asked for a raise and was denied.

It's not uncommon for states to restrict car sales to dealership, prohibiting direct sales from car manufacturers. There are historical reason why this is so in the US. In short for all the bad reasons; there are really no good reasons to give preferences to dealerships vs manufacturers.

What this bill is actually about... To bypass existing laws, Tesla opened a ""store"", not a ""dealership."" This bill apparently simply closes whatever loophole Tesla used to classify their ""store"" as a ""store"" instead of as ""dealership"". Basically leveling the playing field between Tesla and other more traditional car companies.

FWIW, Tesla is well known to insist on direct sales, and doesn't want to engage into classic dealership model the rest of the industry is using.

IMO, they simply got it backwards with this bill. Instead of removing dealership requirements, and allowing direct sales of any car, they are attempting to force Tesla (and other new automakers) to open dealership franchises instead.

If you took CA as an example, especially during COVID, homelessness went rampant. Not only did it go rampant, but homeless individuals generally congregated around specific areas, such as areas with a lot of people and food. Notable areas in LA would be around Food Banks such as the LA Mission, or large touristy areas such as Sunset Blvd (Hollywood).

This brings many issues to the community.

* Businesses lose business, because the increase of homelessness deters individuals from visiting said business(es) if a hundred homeless people were outside.
* Violence and crime increases amongst the homeless community.
* A lot of drugs are brought into the area, further exacerbating the violence and crime issues.
* A massive mess is made, which becomes exponentially more costly to the city to consistently clean, which is taxpayer money.
* Either more cops need to be hired for said crimes (meaning more taxpayer money spent) or LA must deviate it's current force to focus on the hotspots and pulls their forces away from other areas they deemed safer that may experience a sudden unexpected crime, but suddenly no officer is nearby.
* More theft occurs, a lot more theft.

But ignoring those facts, I too am guilty of wanting to help, and feed those in need. There's more reasons than above on why LA made feeding the homeless illegal, to an extent.

* There's already designated organizations LA has delegated the job of feeding homelessness. These organizations are in specific areas to pull the homeless population towards them, and not around areas like Sunset Blvd.
* These organizations also have resources to further help the homelessness, such as finding them shelter, clothes, treatment, etc.
* They're protecting those that try to feed homelessness outside the organization. But what protection do you need when you feed them?
   * Not all people are good people, including those in need. There are some bad homeless people who can and will attack those good Samaritans to steal their belongings.
   * If your food wasn't cooked well and caused food poisoning, or some other issue arose from your food you fed to the homeless, you're liable and at risk of being sued. Not only can this happen, but it HAS happened. There have been good Samaritans sued by homeless for millions. Can you imagine helping someone and they sued you for your life income and they won?
* By having officers actively punish those feeding the homeless as well, LA can deter individuals handing out food in areas they're trying to pull homeless out. LA Mission can only do so much, but if you go to Sunset Blvd cause there are some homeless there and start feeding them yourself, you're giving the population there a reason to not move towards the LA Mission. You further exacerbate the issue on Sunset Blvd, and now LA Mission needs to start from scratch essentially.

I've volunteered at so many Food Banks, and I see police officers there all the time on their ofttimes helping out as well. These are usually the same officers handing out tickets to unauthorized individuals handing out food. It's not that the officers or the city doesn't care, they're trying hard. Homelessness is an issue, not targeting the individuals that are homeless though. There are right ways to handle these issues. If this Food not Bombs group wants to help feed the homeless, they should help the city with a strategy. Not just set up base wherever they want. They think they're helping, but for all we know, the street they chose to set up base may now be targeted with crimes over the next few weeks. They harmed far more than they helped.

1714,,"As someone who has worked with manufacturing all over Asia, I can say with 100% certainty that that India is nothing like any other Asian country (with regard to manufacturing).

Quality control is a completely foreign concept there. Working with Chinese manufacturers, compared to Indian ones, is like working with people from an entirely different planet. 

Examples: We found certain an Indian electronics manufacturer using Filtrete Furnace Filters that were duct taped to their air intakes. Typically, an entire, fairly sophisticated, air purification system is needed in electronics manufacturing facilities. These guys were using the low end of a regular houses' furnace filter. They didn't even spring for the fucking allergen ones. Not that it would have mattered. They're letting in thousands of times more particles than they should be. And these particles end up messing up the electronics, causing rates of failure that destroyed any potential profit. 

Another example: Fully Bunny Suits are a common thing in electronics manufacturing. We found a factory in India having their employees use paint coveralls, rubber dishwashing gloves, and painter's masks (the cheap ones). No eye covering. No restriction on deodorant, shampoo, and other chemicals people use on themselves. That restriction is standard in these facilities.

2 kids, ~16 years old, cornered a younger kid ~14 years old. Those are ages where there can be a crazy difference in development: physical, emotional, and mental.

This incident happened in a school environment where there must have been some indicator that there was bullying and an overall threat level that I’d like to think we wouldn’t tolerate in any other civilized society or organization.

No part of any part of the incident or immediate emergency response escalation was handled by anyone with a fully developed brain.

It doesn’t go deep enough to say that the School should at least somewhat liable here.

It’s not like most schools have, or properly dictate resources to actually mitigating serious bullying issues.

Having had the fortunate experience of attending a high school where there was a really solid counsellor to student ratio, who were good, and at least one counsellor would know each student really well - it helped.

Partially because collectively they had a good picture of the dynamics going on within the school at any given time.

Partially because it was decent mental health care, and they’d actively work with each kid to their own success.

Had a problem in a class? They’d hear you out and get to the root of the issue & on to actioning it if the student was ok with the next steps. Whether it was problems at home, extra academic help, needing to be in an accelerated class, separation from a peer, or beef with a teacher.

All in all it seemed to help prevent any sort of serious issue from happening. It was a far more peaceful high school experience than most.

I hope all of the kids involved receive really good counselling, like, right away. These are some very young psyches that lived through a very traumatic situation. They are doing so at a time when extreme violence in schools is such a constant, all while their brains are developing.

The school already failed these kids here. Most schools would never stand the chance because they don’t have anywhere close to the resources necessary.

I hope they aren’t let down again. The next best chance they have is to start getting good help now (mental and legal) to process & navigate living in the aftermath

Back then, if you didn't have your own pen/pencil teachers would look at you like you were such a disappointment, a disaster, and letting you borrow a pencil was like such a huge inconvenience for them.  The teacher  gave me a brand new pencil and told all of the students that they'd have to wait for me to go sharpen it with the manual sharpener, before we could start our work.  

After class I went straight up to Danny and pushed him with one hand so hard that he fell on his ass.  He looked at me in shock and everyone laughed.  After school Danny and his friend followed me walking a mile home while egging me to fight them.  I wasn't stupid enough to fight 2 vs 1.  I walked fast and did not engage or talk to them.  When I had gotten to about 100ft of my house, they suddenly turned and disappeared.  

The  next day, I was called to the principal's office.  He asked me why I pushed Danny.  I explained but he didn't seem  to believe me.  He asked me ""Now why would Danny steal your pencils?""  ""They followed you home but didn't try to hurt you?""  He said that I should stay away from Danny, that he's a known gang member and it's better if I try not to upset him.   

I felt like there was  no one  on my side, so I had to take care of myself.  The next  day, I came to school with a knife in my backpack.  If Danny was a gang member, then I had to adequately protect myself.  I was fine with fighting him 1 vs 1.  He was fat and short, but strong.  I would  have  only taken out the knife if it ended up being 2 vs 1 again.   After school I walked home slowly, like half  speed,  waiting for him  to catch up to me, but he never came.

She told me to compare the turbulence to being on a boat, riding the waves, with their troughs and peaks and not to worry. Having grown up on a large lake in Northern Ontario, I was very familiar with that experience. That essentially instead of bounding along the surface in a boat, we  were riding the air waves and as safe as all that. It worked as a physical metaphor and became much more manageable in my mind and not nearly so threatening to compare it like this. Plus, it’s true. And some turbulence is expected on most flights and *any* coping strategy is a *good* strategy as there’s nowhere to escape *to*.   
  
But I’d been with a friend many years ago in his Cessna flying high above Toronto when we suddenly hit *a thermal*. The small two seater plane dropped about 200 feet in a second and a half and startled us both. The rest of the flight was uneventful.   
  
But what these people went through would make anyone shit their shorts. “Riding the waves” would be like encountering a tsunami on an dinghy. No bloody thanks. I’m glad they’re all safe: that’s truly a frightening and dangerous experience. I don’t even think I’d be able to scream…

Video appears to show Texas drag bill author dressed in drag
A social media user shared a video that appears to show Texas state Rep. Nate Schatzline wearing a black sequined dress while skipping through a park.

A Texas lawmaker who authored a bill that would restrict drag performances appears to have dressed in drag himself while a student.

A video that surfaced on Twitter and TikTok this week appears to show Texas state Rep. Nate Schatzline, a Republican, skipping, running and dancing in a park while donning a black sequined dress and a red eye mask. At the end of the roughly 90-second video — which plays over the song “Sexy Lady” by Javi Mula — the four participants are named, including Schatzline, whose character is called “The Virgin.”


“Nate Schatzline has made his entire personality attacking the LGBTQ community, trans especially children, and vowed to ban drag shows in Texas,” the Twitter user, who did not respond to a request for comment, wrote. “Here is Nate… in drag.”

Schatzline, a first-term state representative and former pastor, did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. However, in a tweet shared Tuesday, he appeared to confirm his participation in the video. 

“Y’all really going crazy over me wearing a dress as a joke back in school for a theatre project? Yah, that’s not a sexually explicit drag show… lol y’all will twist ANYTHING,” he wrote.

While Schatzline’s performance in the video would meet most dictionary definitions of “drag,” it is unclear whether it would be prohibited under the legislation Schatzline introduced in January.

The legislation, HB 1266, seeks to amend Texas’ Business and Commerce Code to define a venue that hosts a “drag performance” and “authorizes on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages” as a “sexually oriented business.” Such businesses, according to the state code, “may not allow an individual younger than 18 years of age to enter the premises of the business.” 

The measure defines a drag performance as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs before an audience for entertainment.” It also states that sexually oriented businesses can be categorized as “a nightclub, bar, restaurant, or other commercial enterprise that provides for an audience of two or more individuals a drag performance.”

Lawmakers in at least a dozen other states have proposed laws that would similarly restrict drag performances, according to an NBC News analysis. Supporters of these bills say they are needed to protect children from exposure to inappropriate entertainment. Critics argue that they unfairly target an art form with deep ties to the LGBTQ community and wrongly paint all drag performances as obscene.

The emergence of Schatzline’s video came several days after an image of what appears to be Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee dressed in drag as a high school student was shared on Reddit and Twitter. Lee’s press secretary, Jade Cooper Byers, did not confirm whether it is Lee in the yearbook photo, previously telling NBC News in an email that “any attempt to conflate this serious issue with lighthearted school traditions is dishonest and disrespectful to Tennessee families.”


Answering reporters’ questions Monday, Lee, a Republican, confirmed that he would sign a recently passed bill that would criminalize drag performances in public and in front of children in the state.

The video of the Texas lawmaker also comes about a month after an image emerged on social media that appeared to show embattled Republican Rep. George Santos of New York in drag. At the time, Santos told reporters as he walked through a New York airport: “No, I was not a drag queen in Brazil, guys. I was young and I had fun at a festival. Sue me for having a life.”

That's like... the whole thing. Drag is funny, it's not inherently sexual like conservatives are trying to make it out to be. Name a kids show back in the 90s and 00s and there's probably an episode of one of the main characters in drag for laughs.

Coli and shigella go hand in hand and are often due to an overuse of a water way by homeless people who use it as a source for bathing and as a toilet. Shigellosis is acquired from contact with contaminated feces. 

  
  
E. Coli contamination is checked typically on a routine monthly, quarterly or semi annual basis per municipal reporting systems. E. Coli contaminations are also more likely to show up in the local news than say something like shigella or legionnaires disease but they all come from the same source. Also shiga toxin is almost identical to e. Coli toxins in the gastrointestinal tract.

HRT changes a person's biology and this has carryover effects on athletic performance. Still, most studies DO SHOW some retained strength and athletic advantages in trans women after HRT, though these studies were largely conducted on individuals that started hormone therapy later in life - ie, after initially undergoing male puberty.

However, this does not mean that every trans woman is going to out-compete cis women.

**If you want the Mormon Church to change it's ways, all it requires is pressure and shaming from the outside.**

(That's the TLDR right there. You can stop reading now to go respectfully tell a Mormon that you disapprove of the way their church protects pedophiles from the law.)

It has worked before, and it will continue to work. Just look at the examples of polygamy, racism, and homophobia.

* Mormons were very invested in their polygamy, including making it a requirement for salvation. (Maximum salvation, that is. Mormons have a multi-tiered salvation model) When the world told them to stop, they said no, but when the US Government threatened to seize their temples, God \*miraculously\* saw fit to reveal \*new\* commandments that outlawed the practice. Boom, reformed.
* Mormons believed that black people were less loyal to God than white people in the war in heaven before we were born. For that reason, they weren't allowed full membership in the Church for most of it's nearly 200-year existence. In 1979, roughly 10 years AFTER the civil rights movement, God finally revealed that the ban should be lifted. Modern Mormons have no explanation for why the ban was imposed in the first place (but it was definitely God, not racist men) and no explanation for why it took so long to be lifted, but they're so happy about it and it was a wonderful blessing from the Lord. (Note: it was a total coincidence that the rest of the world had been pressuring the Church to integrate for years) Boom, reformed.
* Mormons have always believed that homosexuality is a sin, but the contrast in the way the church approached the issue a few years ago and the way they handle it today is extremely telling. In the past, the church openly instructed it's members to vote for anti-gay legislation and they flatly condemned homosexuality as a sin. Today, about 15 years and 1 lost culture war later, the church loves and embraces members who experience ""same-sex attraction"" and they backed a recent bill protecting gay marriage. They went from chest-thumping condemnations to egg-shell-walking justifications in just a few short year. They're in full retreat on this issue, and 10 years from now they're going to be pretending that they never even cared about sexual orientation in the first place. Boom, reform~~ed~~ \-ing.

Since it's inception, the Church has been fleeing it's reputation as a fundamentalist cult. They want to live their beliefs, but they VERY much care what others think of them. They stick to their regressive guns as long as they can to help maintain the pretense that the teachings of the Church are constant and unchanging, but eventually the pressure builds to the point where ""God"" finally comes along to reveal that the Church's persecutors are actually correct in their condemnation, and so they reluctantly reform and rewrite history to reflect that they were always doing the right thing.

It's not getting as much attention as I wish it would, but the church was recently investigated by the SEC and it was revealed that they've been committing tax fraud for decades, hiding billions of dollars behind a wall of shell companies. They collect 10% of their members' personal income as tithing, and then use those ""sacred funds"" to make literal billions on the stock market.

**Mormonism is a business, tithing is their revenue stream, and cult shit doesn't sell. Mormons want you talking about how ""nice"" and ""happy"" they are, because that's good marketing. Being widely condemned for shielding pedophiles and rapists from the law is bad for business.**

As a final note, you should know that the church has no internal reform mechanisms. No suggestion box, no opportunity to submit feedback. They're led by a prophet who supposedly speaks to god, so members' opinions are not welcome. How are you supposed to argue with God, right? The only thing that moves these geriatric sociopaths is the external, existential threat of being seen for what they really (currently) are by the outside world. They love it when you make jokes about having lots of wives, because there hasn't been polygamy in the mainstream church for a long time and it's easy to spin that into persecution. It actually helps them keep their flock under control. But asking hard questions that can't be hand-waved away? That's fatal. Like how is it OK for a prophet of God to lie about billions of dollars, hiding it from the government and his own followers? How is it OK for a Mormon bishop to know that a member of his ward is regularly raping his daughter, and not report it to the authorities? Why does the church maintain a colossal dragon horde of money instead of using it to help the less fortunate?

This is 10x longer than I meant for it to be, but it's cheaper than therapy so I'm not going to edit it down to a normal length. Sue me.

#

>In the wake of the AP’s investigation last year, Republican state Rep. Phil Lyman and Democratic Rep. Angela Romero announced plans to reform Utah’s clergy-penitent privilege loophole. Lyman, who served six years as a Latter-day Saints’ bishop, said at the time lawmakers should want to reexamine the loophole “regardless of religious or political affiliation.”

>“People should be able to go and confess their sins to their bishop without fear of being prosecuted up until when they are confessing something that has affected someone’s else life significantly,” he told the AP in August.

For context, I'm a practicing Christian and I prosecuted child sex crimes for years in state court. I have no patience for what I've found to be naive views about penitent child sex abusers, but I also think there is value in counseling with clergy generally. 
 
The exemption is not about reporting abusive *pastors*, it's about pastors not reporting things they learn in confession. Of course, pastors confess abuse as well, so the two aren't mutually exclusive. Most states still either have this exemption or don't require reporting from clergy at all, so Utah is hardly alone.

The exemption comes from traditional protections for privileged communication, like those for attorney-client and physician-patient.  Every state more or less exempts attorney-client communication about past conduct. 

The US's pretty widespread mandatory reporting requirements for mental health professionals are controversial, and studies have shown that people avoid treatment over fear of mandatory reporting. I believe, in an effort to encourage treatment, most countries do not require psychologists to report. Are we fostering *more abuse* by not allowing abusers to seek professional counseling?

This lab is highly financed but they refuse to do any research on synthetic biology because this individual is a Baptist and believes that synthetic biology is contrary to God's plan. 

This sort of nonsense is unbelievable but true because of the politics of US academic research. You've got to have connections to get a top-level job at a research institute and unfortunately in the United States one of the easiest ways to make those conservative political connections is through church attendance and we need to be clear that scientific research in the United States is, in fact, a very conservative business because so much money is on the line. People get quite serious when money is involved. A nation that refuses to take risks is going to have a difficult time making technological progress. This guy actually thinks the church is a bunch of nonsense but he got his position because of his church connections and he refuses to make waves because he loves his cushy job that he had to play this stupid game to get, so he does the ""right"" thing and plays along with the game. This is so sleazy. 

Look at the damage that George W. Bush did to stem cell research with his religious fanaticism about ""satanic"" chimeras and the use of aborted fetal cells for research. The issues is  less that China has a better educational system, they don't, but more that they're not encumbered by a reactionary conservative political establishment that worms its way into any high paying position through a social network that originates in religious institutions.

The politics of power and money in the United States is poisonous to innovation. Innovators need to be able to take risks, nobody takes risks when they're obsessively paranoid about losing their privilege and willing to do the dirty work for their buddies in order to hold on to what they got through their connections. The privilege that comes with conservative connections is too seductive for many people in tech to resist. It's not their problem, they're doing fine. That attitude kills progress in the US and leaves the door open for other nations to jump ahead. I would expect very little exciting biotech coming out of the US in the coming decades. It will come, but it will come from overseas.

He struck up a friendship with one man in particular and kept inviting him to the white church. The man was understandably resistant to this idea, but grandpa was one of the most stubborn people anyone could ever come across and wore him down. Grandpa took the whole ""we are all children of God"" thing literally and didn't see any reason anyone would look down on anyone else due to skin color or orientation or anything else. So this guy comes to his church and absolutely everyone ignores him. They refused to bring him communion. Grandpa got down from the pulpit, ripped the stuff out of someone's hands, and took it to him himself. Then he got back up to the pulpit and told everyone off. Said how that's not Christ-like behavior and how ashamed he was of all of them. That night, there was a cross burning on his lawn. A week later he moved his family back to his home state. (If he hadnt had young children, he probably would have stayed and fought it out.) When I think of all these so called Christians and their horrible bullshit, I think of my Grandpa and how ashamed he would be of all of them.

Quoting from my father, who was an Episcopalian for many years and is now part of the ACNA over [similar issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States\)#LGBT_Issues) - moderate Christians tend to ""deal with politics by not dealing with them."" They rationalize their avoidance of taking a difficult stance by abstracting the issue. Gay people are considered sinners, but *all* of us are sinners, who are we to judge, etc. You can get surprisingly tolerant behavior out of Christians with this angle!

But as soon as your organization takes a stance that *explicitly contradicts Church doctrine*, you force them out of this abstract ambiguity and make them confront it directly. ""Do I actually believe in my religion?""^[1] You will very likely lose in this confrontation.

Moral of the story - if you feel that strongly about the issue, you should secure alternative funding before you explicitly contradict words in the Bible and force your donors to predicate continued support on abandoning their faith.

^[1] I recall a church meeting over the issue of gay bishops where my dad said, ""Look, at this point we might as well shut the whole thing down and head on over to the Unitarians. They're nice people, they'd be happy to have us, and it would be more honest than pretending that we believe in anything at all."" That did not go over well.

2951,,"The problem with Christianity (besides the fact that it is utter contradictory bullshit) is that the old testament and the new testament give entirely separate rules of behavior and judgement. 

Old testament God demands death for everything from adultery to disrespecting your parents to just being on land that the Israelites wanted. For example, Psalm 137:9 “Blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.” 

Old Testament God was vengeful, unforgiving, blood thirsty and EVERYTHING was an abomination worthy of severe punishment. Which is exactly how modern Christians behave. Being gay IS an abomination in the old testament. 

But when Jesus comes along suddenly God is all chilled out and telling everyone to forget all that stuff my father commanded before and just love each other. 

So what is a modern Christian supposed to do? Toss out 90% of the book that is the cornerstone of their faith and listen solely to the zenned out hippie? The obvious answer that we see every day is a resounding NO. Most of the bible, most Christians and human nature in general skews towards dominance, judgement, fear of the unknown and a malignant need for superiority. Jesus's doctrine never stood a chance.

Hatred is a drug to the masses.  Bigotry is the vehicle but hate is the fuel.  The “leaders” of these groups are not interested in the actual religious teachings, but rather how it can be harnessed for their own benefit.  The benefits they pursue are money, influence and ultimately power over others.  

These are not religious leaders.  They are psychological drug dealers preying on self doubt.  Religion is a means to an end for them, and saving souls is the public face they put on.

Thus, we are *ordered* to be boundless in our forgiveness, and are only in a state of grace, are only in communion with Him, when we have only love in our hearts.  When we sit in judgment of others, we steal from God’s dominion.  With most of our sins, the victims are our neighbors, or even more likely our own selves.  But when we judge others, we are acquiring an authority that does not belong to us.  We are actually stealing *directly* from God’s dominion.  We are committing the crime of theft, and the victim of that crime is God himself, not the person you are judging.

It amazes me how many people identify as “Christian” but then are so openly hostile to the teaching of Christ.  The retort I so often hear is that it’s possible to subscribe to a group and not believe *every* belief that group espouses.  As if Jesus’s order to love and forgive was something he just mentioned in passing that one time, and didn’t want us to get all hung up on.  Or that it’s possible to have *similar* beliefs but not interpret certain messages the same way.

* [T]he individual flew with others to Washington D.C. ""on January 5, 2021"" to incite violence.

It's not just the cars that are variables in need of maintenance but the tracks themselves can drift out of alignment and we are talking about fractions of an inch that can make a difference.

I used to work for a railroad in the signal department which was responsible for the sorts of equipment that detects when an axle is overheating (like was involved in this crash). Something I find myself wondering about now that we have determined that the crew got a warning about the overheating axle just before the derailment is if the derailment had something to do with trying to suddenly stop the train in response to the warning.

I am not trying to imply human error here. These trains are ridiculously long and the car brakes are triggered one after the other. 

My point after saying that derailments are something we can never get down to zero would be to question why hazardous material like vinyl chloride was being moved along on a train with so many cars at such a high speed. It would seem that hazardous materials should require special treatment. Like slower speeds and shorter trains with less cars.
