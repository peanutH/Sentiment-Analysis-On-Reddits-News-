       "'nanthat a weird way of saying she raped a child and forced him to become a parenti hope the da loses their job over this this is a miscarriage of justicewtf we sentence people to jail for far less she should be spending years in prisonshe was 31 male child was 13 this is messed upjustice failed this childwhy the fuck did they need a plea deal do a genetic test of the baby bam proof they had sex take that shit to courti feel like if she was a man and he was a little girl it would definitely be different i think everyone here knows that would be the caseno jail time for woman who admitted sex raping a having his baby there ftfyand she has edit incels please stop bitching about women in my mentions women aren t evil and it s not their fault you re lonelyi know it sucks for the baby and it s not their fault but this 13 year old should never have to pay child supportno jail time for female pedophile there fixed the titlebetween this and that pastor who got off easy while raping his 10 year old because he a christian man this country is fucked it super duper fucked that the douchebags are all like we must protect the children from sex stuff but when people actually fuck kids they are either like he a good person still or no it ok he married her afterwards with the consent of the churchhaving sex with the term you re looking for is rapedpedophile gets no jail time because female treat pedophiles the same regardless of gender and somehow the pedophile has custody of her product of said pedophilianext thing you know the old will be to pay child supportthat s not healthy for societythat disgusting she a predator he a victim this literal child should not be under any obligation to care for the child that was conceived as a result of his rapesomething somwthing something boys cant be raped by women unless she penetrates him with an object cause you cant rape him he has to have a boner honestly woudnt surprise me to see the 13 year old ends up in jail for failure to pay child support in a few years cause throw this bitch in prison for fucks sakeoh so it cool to rape now as long as you do it in colorado springs matt kroschel not using the word rape isgrow plants we dont like jail mandatory minimums convicted felon never vote again x200b older female statutory rape a 13 year old boy and have his baby heyo what a lucky kid high five x200b fuck the justice systemdeletedquit giving sexual predators breakswhat is it with journalists that ca spell the word rape when the rapist is a woman raping a child speculation i bet she sued him for child support and won tooi see a lot of hating on her and worry about the old i worried about the baby she is going to raise him child protective services needs to be watching that like a hawk that situation is almost inevitably going to end up abusivepedophile piece of shitwhen are headlines going to get it right it not sex if a child is involvedand what put a child on child support the government is pushing pedophilia and we forced into complacencystatutory rape holy fuck what a horrible article it s fucking wrong to frame these articles this way change the title 13 year old kid has to worry about raising a child and you people can t even call a spade a spade fuck off no jail time for women who admitted to statutory rape of 13 year old having his baby this 13 year old kid is going to be made to have to even exist in the same sphere as this child and raise it is so fuckinghow does it even work to take the kid to school if you a registered sex offender you ca go within a certain distance of a schooli thought we were targeting pedos how is this case specialandrea neenet serrano 31 is accused of having a sexual relationship with the boy who serrano said viewed her as a mother figure according to serrano arrest affidavit w t httpsi really do know how she is not sitting in a jail cell right now digging a bit deeper i wonder if the 13 year old parents should also be investigated why were they trusting their kid with this random woman after being reported to the fountain police department serrano was interviewed by detectives and confessed to having a sexual relationship with the boy the affidavit states that serrano told detectives the victim spent several nights at her house and was even living with her for several weeks serrano stated to detectives that he the victim looked at her serrano like a mother figure and even called her mom before after being interviewed serrano also disclosed she was pregnant with the victim child httpsamerican court is a joke and needs full replacementthat is fucking nasty ew wtf and he going to have a kid too damn kid life is fuckedthe boy is lucky they are forcing him to pay child support bitch becomes registered sex offender but is also allowed to keep a baby boy she can rape whenever she wants there are two underlying societal problems showing here one is the belief that rape does count if the victim is a man or young boy because men want sex all the time so getting raped is them getting lucky and the second one is the belief that there no such thing as female pedophile or that a female pedophile is less harmful and not predatory like male pedophiles basically they see this act as a one time thing which is why she has custody of a male child because it did even once cross their minds that she just do the same to her sonbut what about the child is likely a good chunk of why she not going to jail personally i say put the kid in foster care if the unfortunate father family does want it and chuck her ass in prisonpoor kid is going to starve having to pay child support out of his lunch moneyanother failure of the justice system i hope that child is getting quality therapy to work through and process the entire situation in a healthy wayand she will probably file for child support from the 13 year oldthis is absolutely wild and a grave miscarriage of justice we put people in prison for simple marijuana possession but this bitch gets off for freetwo separate systems of justicerapist pedophile sees no jail time and has full custody of the child born by rape it a woman tho so it chill guyscan t wait to see the update where the 13 year old gets dragged to court for failing to pay child support and gets the book thrown at himand if it was reversed i guarantee the adult male wouldn t be walking home scott free talk about doubleif the roles was reversed definitely different outcomes the lady is a rapist period a child can not consentany adult man or woman who d have sex with a 13 year old child is not fit to raise a child put it this way an adult man has sex with a 13 yr old girl and gets custody of the child because he s the father just because that woman is an adult can t make it okay birth mother or not this is classic policy defies logic thinking by the authorities in charge of these decisionsthis woman should definitely not be raising a kid please let them get adopted by a good familyyou know that double standard of men can sleep with as many chicks and he wants and he s a legend but if i girl does it she s a slut allow me to present the other side of that double standard if this was a male dude would be life in prison if not murdered by a family member on the way to court there would also be a nation wide outrage about this and reddit would filled to the max with articles about it this will be buried in a few hours and be forgotten abouteven the mother of the 13 year old says that this rapist is getting away with it because she is a woman our society is fucked uplet me ftfy no jail time for a woman that raped a boythis rapist pedophile needs to be locked away raping a child should not be a crime where you can take a plea deal and avoid going to jailraped a child and forced him into becoming a parent with no jail time is insane can you imagine if the genders where reversed goddamnis he going to have to pay child support i ca imagine how much that would be on a allowancedeletedhaving sex it fucking r a p e you noncesnot much child support from a paper route thoughwatch she will file for child support next i bet she collects state benefits on this little rape baby she made i hope this family gets custody of that poor baby from this rapist before she rapes her own child next disgustinghaving sex with they can just call it rapeso we still not calling it for what it is huhraped she raped the 13 year old let not try to pretty it up under terms of the plea deal reviewed by kktv and that the suspect signed off on serrano will be required to register as a sex offender and the judge could sentence her to 10 years to life on sex offender intensive supervised probation serrano will avoid any jail time since the district attorney s office dropped the original charges to a lesser charge that does not come with mandatory jail time what the fuck is this she had better spend the rest of her life on that registry and be watched for the entirety of the time she on it the victim s family is also looking ahead to the next steps in this case they plan on asking the courts to give the custody of the baby currently serrano has custody serrano will find out in may how long she ll be on probation i a very firm believer of not allowing a rapist custody of their rape babynotice that the headline reads had sex with if the roles were reversed it would have said raped call it what it is the double standard needs to stop regardless of sex or gender these people are pedophiles and rapistsrape she raped a 13 year old childjust wait until he has to pay child support payments to his rapist are we allowed to talk about female privilege yet or are males the only ones getting privilege checked stilleven the article title is fucked up not sex rape the word they looking for is rape a 13 year old ca consent to sex with a old what the fuck is wrong with the world now i angrythanksgiving dinner gon na be really awkward this year and next year and the year after that always gon na be awkwardnice to see the double standards south park pointed out all those years ago are still alive and wellthere s no way a sex offender should ever get a plea deal has colorado springs never heard of mary kay letourneau she kept going back to her victim because they were in fun fact she died from colorectal cancer in 2020kinda feel like there are certain legal situations where there should be mandatory minimums adults should be banging kids period edit i get that the situation becomes stickier because they have to put the baby with family or in foster care but nobody should be raping kids and the fact that the law goes out of it way to treat a women who is a legal adult with kid gloves is wrong considering she a kiddie diddler tooin most states sex with any one under 14 is automatically years obviously not in coloradowhy do the prosecutors get to offer a deal that the victim do sign off on are the prosecutors supposed to be seeking justice for the victim herejust seen a post about a guy that has served a 15 year prison sentence for cannabis possession and this bitch gets nothing for rape of a minorhow is she not getting jail time she s a child predator disgustingrape the word is rape not had sex withpretty sure if rolls were revered the man would be sentenced to 30 years to life she raped a 13 year old boy gets pregnant has the baby and gets no we truly do live in a fucked up and twisted world smh edit just wanted to add that this will also forever fuck up that boys life being a dad at that age and no longer having the chance to be a normal teenagerjust throwing this out there for people who are mad at the news organization for not using the word rape colorado does not have any statute with that term what we all know as rape is defined as sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault in the colorado legal system in this particular case had they gone to trial she would have been charged under colorado s revised statute 1 d the news outlet is just legally covering their ass as if they we re to call her a rapist it might open the doors to a libel suit they should have used the phrase sexually assaulted as that is applicable assuming she pled to the above statute but with a lesser sentencethis is the result of a culture that values men for being sexual beings men certainly are when they get raped especially when they underage this is a rite of passage it trauma that will follow the victim for the rest of his liferapeed a 13 year old not had sex when will reporters call it what it isi am so tired of rapists including statutory wtf that s disgusting and wrong on every level not being treated accordingly rapists so rarely get held accountable and doing it to a child is an extra layer of evil she s a pedophile and i hope they can get that baby away from her justice system indeedmary kay letourneau would like a wordi just audibly gasped wtf wtf that woman is a fcking pedophile how is this oki feel like my son is robbed of his childhood now he s having to be a father he s a victim and he s going to have to live with that for the rest of his life the victim s mother said i feel like if she was a man and he was a little girl it would definitely be different they would be seeking more i feel like because he is not a woman they are not they are having compassion for her the victim s mother said source the article linkedrape and sex crimes really just are treated and punished as crimes so often so many predators getting off scott freegood thing she did have any reefer or she be facing hard timeshe s a child molester she should have gotten jailas a woman this is sick and a double standard if it was a man he be in prison for 30 years with a sex offender label for the rest of his life put that woman in jail for child rape and abuse this is sick afrape the word your looking for is rapedudes will go to jail for 30 years for a smelly leaf but a woman rapes a kid and no one caresit s rape call it what it isno jail time for woman who admitted raping child ftfyin a few years bro has to pay his rapist for child support and watch her buying purses for herself instead of spending it on the god the west is beyond fuckedno jail time for rapist who raped a 13 year old having his babyincredibly sad she raped him unrealthe victim will probably be forced to pay child support to his rapistadmitted to raping not having sex withi m so fucking tired of this shita woman who admitted to having sex with a boy and then becoming pregnant with his child won t face any jail time under a plea deal with obviously having sex is an incorrect term here that is rape statutory at the least this occurred in colorado where the age of consent is 17 years old this title should be changedshe did have sex with the child she raped him that headline is one of the ways we minimize abuse committed by women against childrenan underage person can not give consent sex without consent is rape women are allowed to rape at will apparentlydisgusting she belongs in jailthis is literally sending the message that if you a woman raping a child is okay absolutely absurdcurious lack of the word rape in that headlineno jail time for rapist who admitted to raping a having his rape baby she will now sue for child support for her rape baby from her underaged and win it in courthow the fuck does a proven admitted pedophile not get jail time what kind of timeline are we onrape she raped a child stop saying that pedophiles had sex with the child when its fucking rapehmmmmmmm she still has custody of a child after having sex with a 13 year oldalmost as bad as that rapist brockthat called statutory rape terrible headlineraping admitting to raping a thirteen year old so fucking sick of this shitthat boy should have the right to have that baby abortedwho admitted having sex with 13 year old boy raped she raped a 13 year old boywhat also sucks is later on in life when the kid gets a job if he does have custody he might have to pay child support to his rapistdouble standards other way around would have probably resulted in a life sentencethis boy was sexualized and used by a predator i missed the part where a drag queen was involvedname the da shame the da vote out the dayou mean she raped himrape is rape there are male survivors stories in this thread here https that were raped by women as children nbsp nbsp chances of thread being locked 85double standard if the genders were reversed the man would get serious jail timewhat the actual fuck like seriously what the fuckso what you saying is that when women rape boys it okcool cool cool cool we letting women get away with child rape nowno jail time for rapist who admitted taking advantage of a having his baby is what the headline should say if it was a man and a 13 year old girl there be fucking outrage and he be in prison forever it does not matter if it was a woman who did this it was still a 13 year old and rape is still fucking rape regardlessfucking pedophile oh what nobody is gon na call her what she is because she a woman are women really allowed to rape children you do have sex with a 13 year old that statutory rape period what the fuck is with the double standardi ca believe this could happend this day and age smh is the kid the 13yo also required to pay child support to this pedophileadmitted sex raping 13 year old there ftfy lock her up and throw away the keyi m so tired of this double standard she fucking raped a kid and we re supposed to pretend it s okaypardon having sex with a 13 year old call it what it is that sexual assault a 13 year old can not consentas a female this disgusts me no matter the gender pedophiles are pedophiles and this is rape give her life in prison like if she was a malerape let call it rape stop calling it sex with a child it fucking grossdeleteddont understand plea deals where theres no one else to give up just a lawyer padding statsis it safe to assume she now go after the rape victim family for child support if they fail to gain custody who approved the plea deal this is an open and shut case of sexual abuse of a minor plea deals are from my limited knowledge used to secure in cases that are expected to be difficult to try in courtgood oldit an underage male and an adult female did we really expect worse it has to be the other way around for the harsh penaltywhy can t they call this rape you know the thing it iswell this is some double standard i do wan na seehaving sex with is a strange spelling of raped a childmaybe change the headline to no jail time for pedophile rapistyou mean raped right she raped a childpussy pass a male would have gone to prison and rightly sothey mixed up the title it admitted rapingjfc stop saying had sex with when referring to an adult sexual assaulting a child a child can t consent until they are 18 therefore she raped that child and forced him to be a parent fucking hell man and no jail time what the fuckso how is he going to afford to pay child supportmust be that male privilege i hear so much aboutshe did have sex with a old she raped a 13 year old x200b wtf is with these headlines x200b if it were a man having sex with a 13 year old it would read rape in every sentencegot ta love how every time it a female predator they had sex with the victim and never raped themsociety does like admitting female pedophiles exist my mother was one and i was abused from age they especially do admit that mothers or anyone with a child would do something like that ironically the proof of the rape here the child is likely to be a contributing factor how the media and courts treat her the cops laughed when i reported at age 15 my father accused me of lying when i was 10 and reached out for help nothing was done until i was 14 and her parental rights were severed then i got sent away to residential places and got more abused for being a traumatized child how society treats victims of female pedophiles is either disbelief or congratulations i nonbinary afab so at the time people just knew me as female they could fathom that a mother could do that to a daughter and so i suffered but i survived i feel for this kid and i hope both children in this get away from her evil being raised by such a person is a risk for that babyi feel like if she was a man and he was a little girl it would definitely be different they would be seeking more i feel like because he is not a woman they are not they are having compassion for her yea without a doubt if she were a man who raped a 13yo girl she would never see the light of day the fact that she a child and they need to ask the court to give custody to the 13 is totally fubar that kid does comprehend what is going on he likely just thought it was super cool and felt special even she took advantage of that now he has to live with this shadow and potentially have a legal battle with the mother for god knows whati feel like my son is robbed of his childhood now he s having to be a father the victim s family is also looking ahead to the next steps in this case they plan on asking the courts to give the custody of the baby i think the parents of the boy are ruining his life by trying to get custody of a child that was born from rape and making him raise it he 13 he needs to focus on his mental health and finishing schoolnanat 36mm in inventory cost i m curious how many actual units this isi think it important to figure out how much of the world economic activity is essentially just worthless plastic garbageright next to the atari cartridges in the desertas i understand how markets work they are throwing away 0 worth of productfools they could be worth something one day my pile of beanie babies and cabbage patch dolls will make me a billionaire they all seethis is why i just collect rockswould it make more sense to donate the product to hospitals children trauma centers etc i would think they could get something on the tax side for this on a side note i used to collect pokémon pops but gave it up it was so incredibly frustrating chasing down all the limited releases and special editions and so on turned out the only way to really collect them was to turn to the secondary market which just raises the prices ridiculously just took all the fun out of the hobbythat where they always belongedevery time i see the funko section in any given store it s usually a solid wall filled with a of them and i always think these are all gon na end up in a what a waste of money plastic etcsurely they could be shredded and recycled into other productsworth 30 million to whom not consumersthey should be fined for polluting and bad aestheticswell then they are worth 30 million they are worth less than zero it costs a lot to dump that much crapso basically a huge tax write off and they get to pollute a landfill because they are greedy fucksi ll buy it holds out in crumpled bills and assorted coins muchthis kind of waste should be taxed heavilywhy not just donate to charitiesdrill all that oil out of the ground refine it into plastic to build these funko pops then put it right back into the ground can someone tell me how this is an efficient use of our planet dwindling resources is this is an example of how capitalism is the most efficient system we have of resource managementi never understood why they are popular i hate that art style they look stupidshame on all of us for not buying enough of their useless crapit kind of amusing that the company is all pikachu face over the concept of there being a market cap on plastic bobble headssend them to kenya they will do something useful with them httpswhere they belong those things are the dumbest shit i have seen so many people waste their money ongod forbid they give then to children for freeas reported by kotaku funko revealed during an earnings call that it has so much idle stock sitting in warehouses that financially its best option is to throw 30 to 36 million worth in the garbage x200b was anyone actually collecting these for future value are they the new version of beanie babiesstop buying useless plastici have no particular issue with funko pops but they got sooooo specific on characters that this was bound to happen people only need so many different variants of a character that appeared in three panels of a comic book a year agoi glad they did try to recycle the materials landfill will make for a fun archeological digi hate that these things are taking up space in the toy industry they re generic figures that barely resembles the characters they re licensingare they gon na be next to the atari cartridgesi feel like their should be a hefty fine for unnecessary waste at that levelthis will devalue the landfilli am just shocked they didn t paint them gold and charge 10x the price for a limited gold editionwild i used to go to their offices in everett wa for some cloud consulting this was probably close to their height as the they saw were insane they had a slide and one of their higher ups loved batman if i remember i thought he had a replica of keaton s batman outfit in his office after we d finish up they d take us to get some free funkos i always declined which usually got a look partially because i was already being paid to go there and i wasn t a huge fan i wondered when they d fade away longer than i thought for sure thoughall of them will end up in a landfill one day let s think about that for a few daysi learning so much in these comments funko is the company that makes them not just the name of the product they are plastic not plushies there are way more produced than i ever imagined there was beanie fervor for themit almost as if that plastic moulded into the vague shape of something you seen on tv does have any intrinsic value weirdcapitalism at its finesta whole bunch of redditors are preparing to go dumpster divingthis seems like a disgusting over valuation of the entire world supply of these stupid thingsthey can all play the et atari game togetheras someone who opens all his funko figures and has zero concerns about resale value i take themthey could donate it to kids in a country like madagascar where toys are insanely expensive 10 toy cars are sold for nealy 50 over there nobody can buy themfunko is model example of useless consumerism ugly useless mass produced and for what so people can use it as another form of currency and later add it to our landfillsjust do see what people see in those things always thought they were just the next beanie babieslet be frank here every one of these figurines will eventually end up in a landfill they are all trash that serve no value other than being something cute to have they are noveltiesimagine that a shit ton of plastic collector garbage going to thecapitalism is the most efficientthey could give them away but why do that when they could just spite people and fill up more landfillswhy not donate can t they write that off or even recycle the materials seems dumb to put it into a landfillcool cause no group homes orphanages or third world countries would get a smile from them with having to eat a little more in logistic costs edit grammar stuffwere they trash in the first placemake a wish foundation could have used a few of sighasshole company why not just donate them to children charities and write it off as a tax deduction oh that s right cause they don t give a fuckdaniel greene would approveif you push the timeline out a few years are all of their products going to the landfill this just saves stepsthat s why this world is fucked and my son loves these dumb ass things so i ll take one of eachgod forbid they like donate them to needy kids or somethingthey ca donate these i sure as shit do want but i bet some poor kids with no toys would love them guess they can go fish them out of the landfills laterwhere do people think they gosuper great awesomewill landfill cleanup costs be someplace in escrowmeanwhile i have one that been on backorder for almost 2 yearswhy tf are they not being sent for recyclingthey shouldn t be allowed to make more until they sell what they already havewhy not sell them cheap or donate themcan t eat like an elephant and shit like a birdi m sure that s great for theat this point why don t we just shoot all our garbage at the sun it would make us good at aiming rockets rightso where exactly are they tossing it asking for a friendi guess they sending zero dollars worth to the landfill if it had value they sell itthat great theyre cutting out the middle man who keeps them on a shelf for a while before they eventually go to the landfilllive long enough you see everything move in cycles looks like people finally figured out funko pops are just beanie babiesthat where they all will end up funko is the new beanie baby it will peak just like bb did and it will be overso does anyone know where abouts this landfill isif you want to find these go check out 2600 s miller rd buckeye az i guessing they go into a dump near byyou mean it all trash always has beeni was wondering when the funko craze would come crashing downi wish the company would focus on cool funkos instead of making 20 pose variations glow in the dark and giant sizeshit like that should straight up not be allowedi used to work at gamestop and resented anyone who bought these things the collectors were the worst part there were very few actually worth any real value but these people would show up right when we get shipments and watch me unbox the pops and check the boxes before i even put a price tag on em this is useless brainless consumerism i hate it i hated seeing people buy tons of worthless shit that they will probably one day just throw out such a wasteful economy we havethat s where trash belongsright by the magic cardsshocking shocking that these ugly ass things are falling out of popularity who could have seen this comingworth if it going to a landfill it worth less than nothing always wasit ai worth shit if nobody bought iti never understood the attraction to buy theseit annoying that geek and nerd shops give up so much of their shelf space to this absolute junk anywaywhy not donate them to the needyi love little figures i own a fair amount of figures i make and paint them but in my earlier days when i was living in japan i collected a decent number of goodsmile and figures from anime games and shows i regularly watch i absolutely can not understand the appeal of these things they hideous it so cheap and ugly mass produced trash look at some of the vinyl figures that are out there something like a nendoroid compare the quality and price to these things i know that not everyone likes anime and games but i feel like if they put some effort in it could look decent but they do i not judging people who buy them but man these things are ugly and low effort these days anyway just buy an sla 3d printer or have a friend with one endless miniatures of far better quality which on average cost less than a dollartil the difference between myself and the ceo of funko one of us knew these were garbage from the beginning and one of us just figured it outbeanie babies for millennialsthese comments are full of they trash anyway sentiments but jesus there are people who like and pay money for these sometimes a lot of money for rare ones you and i may think it silly but really all collectibles and maybe even everything that is essential to living can besheesh that stupid buy em for pennies on the dollar and do some melting cutting abomination have artists come in and transform them kinda like the dunny by kidrobotthat where they belong frankly do get me wrong i have plenty of plastic just being eye candy on my shelf too but these things are even cool they just strip the characters of 90 of their personalities and design elements and call it a daymaha momma sed garbage is as garbage doesthere a star wars store near me and half their stuff is goddamn funko pops i fucking despise those things with the power of a supernova all of those stupid figures need to be shot into the sunwhy do they donate it instead to needy someone finish this for me pleasedumping them in a landfill is a better option than donating them to a children s hospital or something even some of them smhthat where all of their products were going to end up anywayto be fair a lot of companies have overstock anyway that i am not surprised what amused me more is how a group of circlejerks here are hating on people for liking funko pops some people like funko pops and it does affect your life in any way it is just like people sexual orientation does affect you in any way at all people are hobby police nowthese stupid things ruined my local vintage pop culture store half the store is taken out by these beady eyed weird looking dollsi try not to judge other people hobbies but i cringe whenever i see anyone with a collection of these things overpriced manchild consumerism flooding the world with plastic yeesh ten bucks says pictures of dudes standing next to a wall of these things can sterilize women and gay dudesyea but what landfill asking for a friendfunko pops are stupid man it feels good to say thatso they are going right where they belong i like a happy ending30 million worth if that were actually true then they would be putting them into a landfillcool now send the restgive it to poor kids and make the idiots who collect this shit pay for the shippinggood that s where they belong such a bad way to support your favorite franchises they look nothing like the real characters and they re just glorified toxic plasticson a long enough time line all their products will end up in a landfilli get it they keep releasing the same figures over and over again i do need 32 different versions of iron mangee funko whatever you do do have a clearance for 5 a pop geddit would want to cannibalize the market and make people think they are only worth 530 million more reasons for them to go out of businesssounds like time for a big bonus for the ceoi ca say for certain if kidrobot paid homage or copied off any vinyl toys in general with their toys but i always thought funko pops were an obvious rip off of those say what you want about the negativity surrounding materialistic collecting of this kind but at least dunnys were 3 tall blindboxed toys in limited quantities that retained resale value after opening they had actual talented and unique artists contribute original designs and you could display them easily in a small space funko pops on the other hand seem to only be valuable if you keep them in their boxes which are quite large for something of this nature are literally just anything in mass quantities and need an excessive amount of space in your home for displayingyou d think people would have learned from the beanie baby crazeuseless stuff that was destined to end up in a landfill quickly even it was sold or given awayinsurance policy they can hand them out for free but then they can be sued for giving away products that caused injury damage etcnanadding that no further treatment was required you re not going to click the headline so here s the important bitwear your sunscreen folksthis is actually very common for people years old normally they lob it off and monitor in almost all cases you die of something else other more dangerous cancers he likely have an annual check by a dermatologist but aside from that nothing will changebasal cell carcinoma no biggie a couple of stitches an itch for a few weeks as long as it removedbasal cell carcinoma almost never spreads of cases have metastasis it the best skin cancer you can geti worked in skin cancer surgery for over 3 years and the thread title comes off as clickbait to me someone looking at the title might think it s a cancerous lesion deep within the chest cavity when in reality it s on the surface and when people hear cancer they may think something extremely serious like breast cancer which is fatal an overwhelming majority of skin cancers if left alone will not be the reason you die in fact we often see patients who are old which is 99 of them btw decline surgery you could die with the skin cancer but it is not going to be the cause of your death people find the recovery process more difficult than the actual skin cancer in short wear your sun screen and don t do tanning beds older generations did not have the same etiquette we did when it comes to protecting skin and tanning booths used to be all the rage and as you re older get annual skin exams so they can catch said skin cancers early as the earlier you catch it the less invasive the procedure will be edit i forgot to mention this but the article specially mentions the lesion was removed entirely during the actual physical this means biden did not have to have the more invasive mohs surgery and it was likely a superficial cancer that was cleared after 1 visitno one ever used sunscreen but the lifeguards white zinc on their nose back in the 70 s it wasn t until the early 80 s they started pushing sunscreen mostly for babies it s no surprise seeing a tan was healthy looking gosh my mom and her friends would fry under sprinklers to get a good tan we were all lobsters every summerif you live long enough the odds are you going to get some form of canceri feel like this is a really irresponsible headlinemy dad had lots of them removed over the years and it usually not a big deal unless they need to do a skin grafti had the same thing this summer completely fine nowplease do not die joedonald about to start bragging about being the perfect physical specimen againwear your sunscreen folks or just stay inside like meeeewhat the fuck was mitch mcconnell doing on biden chestwell thank god they were able to get it out of him cancer is terrible and i wouldn t wish it upon anybody i hope going forward he s able to combat any that might still be in his bodycan it be grafted onto andrew tatewas it covered in some orange makeup and have a bad comboverremovedcue all the pro life jackasses celebrating someone having canceri had one on my face the doctor told me that if you had to pick a cancer basel cell was the right choice it strictly from too much sun exposurethis is good news i hate to admit it but if this was about trump i would feel the same way dying from cancer is a horrible way to go even for bad people i rather have trump be forced to face consequences for his horrible acts during his lifetimeluckily it was an easily treatable form of cancer and was common but this is concerning nonethelesslook i may not be a big fan of his but i still glad that it was removed as i usually do wish death on people if i ever do so if i am going to wish death on people it will have to be guys like members of terrorist organizations along with many other subhuman scum that will go so low in hell that they will be low enough to see satani did think biden let mccarthy that closeplease for the love of god do not die this dude is the only thing standing between us and either president xanax or if she s forced to run on her own ticketremovedis this a hipaa violation i always thought patient health information was privatemy father in law had a small skin cancer removed and i think it was one of these i use this as a way of encouraging my kids to wear sunscreen he s fine now but while it was healing it looked like it hurtand that s the attack linerelevant story from 2009 httpsit s refreshing to have this level of honesty and transparency from the white house againdeletedi do know if i could bring myself to remove it i can already feel it growing on meit d be nice if us folk who can t get health care could get a legion off of our chestnansee ya next month once in a generation eventit had snowed were i live since 1949no more once in a generation events pleasewe seem to be having events with regularityif this keeps getting worse i plan to get to a library and wait for dennis quaid to rescue me anyone is welcome to come with except howard from 10 cloverfield lane you stay putone in a generation if you re 95 years old maybe the rest of use get to see the world changei recall writing a paper on climate change a few years ago in college in summary i was writing about latitudes similar to colorado what it said was that while snowfall events number of times it snows would decrease but severity of event how much snow drops would increasei like how we have events once a month nowseem to be getting quite a few of those in a eventsin terms of half of the state being out of drought i hope we do get lazy and go back to out unsustainable water usage we probably will but there always hope i guesspeople seem to be acting like a generation is 80 years or something it s typically defined as years and considering the news here reports that it s the most snow we ve seen since 2008 and is on par with 1983 but falls well short of the record set in the 1950 s i m ok with the headline even if it is somewhat sensationalizedany other z peeps tired of these once in a lifetime events running absolute train on our generationscalifornia is the real winner here despite the difficulties this is causing in some places most of their reservoirs depend on snowmelt so this will go a long way toward filling those back up also the state has never looked more beautiful with lush green grass and snow in the mountainsuntil next the year after thatthere was an avalanche 40 miles outside downtown la yesterday let that sink inso that means it now an annual eventwe seem to be having a lot of thosesoooo same time next yearprepare for the meltingmaybe once in the last generation not this onethey really should call it climate instability might get across that all the things that got taken for granted are no longer grantedeveryday lately feels like a once in a generation kinda day thoit is change getting used to breaking the climate models is the new normali know this means great things for the water table but it also means a killer fire season is in our not too distant future i m kinda tired of living through all these once in a generation eventsonce in a generation events seem to happen constantly because there is more than one type of event and there is more than one place i believe climate change is changing the likelyhood of certain events happening but that change can happen in both directions can we even say with confidence that climate change is making big winter storms more likely in californiathey need a new phrase i tried of hearing of all the once in a generation events we seem to be having every month or sothe three saints of the transverse ranges are absolutely beautiful right now i mean these mountains are normally breathtaking but even more so now with all the snow going to be a whole lot of snowmelt in the coming weeksi hope its able to fill up lake isabella kern county needs it backto paraphrase inigo montoya you keep using that phrase i do not think it means what you think it meansi didn t not think it will be just once in a lifetime more of a normwe seen to be getting these once in a generation and 500 or 1000 year events quite frequently do you think something might be amiss with the planets climatethis only applies to california oregon and washington are at average snowfalli do know about you guys but i tired of eventsas a millennial just want to say in regards to events we seem to be having alot of thosei ve read this title more in the last year than my whole lifelast once in a generation event last once in a generation event last get the gistthis is what climate change literally means what you expect for weather is no longer the norm and it results in things like 13 counties being declared a state of emergency since bureaucracy prevents large areas from adopting to an evolving worldhttps this is san francisco right now this is the first time many californian coastal inhabitants are experiencing snow for the first timethis will happen again next year climate extremes are just startingi went to college in flagstaff nau because all the pamphlets promised snow for the 4 years i was there the local ski resort only opened once and the slopes were absolute trash because there was effectively zero snow i just saw today that flagstaff has received 140 of snow this year 2023 2 months i texting old college buddies and they all man we never even saw half that while we were there by brother in christ we never saw an 16th of thatdae onc in liftim event lol my god you people are intentionally misunderstanding the phrase for updoots a once per lifetime event a state over to the east does mean you should expect another once in a lifetime event a state over to the west a once in a lifetime weather emergency does mean you should expect to see a once in a lifetime earthquake a once in a lifetime storm does mean you should expect a once in a lifetime heat wave fuckin hell this kind of comment is dumbcan t wait for the summer to break heat records oh boy its getting bad isn t iti wonder if the fellow in thinks the scientists are right nowso naturally that means we can expect this to be the new normalinsert low effort joke about being weekly hereyeah there is snow like 20 minutes south of which need i remind people is a fucking desertthis is really sort of depressing to me at least where i at it used to snow more regularly when i was a kid i even remember it would not be unusual to have at least a couple of weeks of actual snowy winter then as the years went on that 2 weeks of snow on the ground would get shorter and shorter until it just rarely even snowed i watched nearly a foot of snow get laid down where i am at with this storm and melt almost entirely within hours the situation in the mountains is certainly impressive but even that should be more of a routine event i feel like half our problem out here is not so much the extreme weather we just had but our lack of preparation after of not seeing much of a need to maintain the sort of infrastructure needed to dig out of and prepare for these eventsnope twice a year from now onlol once in a generation event y all mfers had us go through three recessions we ll see the snow again next yearhaha hahahaha ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha surethis has happened before many times in california and i just one generation everything is hyped even the weatheral gore was always right about global warming that means we must fear for manbearpig is also realwait has there been unusually heavy snowfall on the west coastremovedit happen again by 2028 we generationing way to quick these daysa human generation is considered to be years so once in a generation is not very comfortingso how does a southern state deal with so much snow i mean i m in canada we expect this and have the to deal with it but how do you manage so much snow when you re in say californiahow many of these once a generation things do we get man it exhaustingso any chance this is going to help the drought situation in those partsof course this year s once in a generation event happens to be the one thing i hope for as a skier and so of course that means i had to move away from the west coast ski areas just as it happensdoesn t seem like that big of a deal we get snow all the time here in ny this is how internet californians respond to any story about an earthquake in some other than california like when buffalo had one recentlywill this help lake mead anybet it happen more frequently moving forwardi bet it s going to be a scorcher in the summer weird weatherheh it was a eventonce in a generation againclimate change says hold my beerummm not anymore the whole country has had that once in a generation this year i think it will happen more often nowwhere have i heard that one beforewe got snow here in scottsdale arizona and the once in a generation snow storm also happened last yeari fucking hope not we need the snowpack like real badno no no it s la niña it s normal for indiana to have 70 degree day in february and march wake up peoplelike everything in natureonce in a generation event sounds like something a fossil fuel company think tank would come up withhere in texas we ve had a winter storm each of the past three yearsseen it twice so far and i bet i see it again before i gowe had about 3 weather events here in buffalo ny within the past 3 monthshow many of these do i get to live through this is like my tenth generational stormsure it is lately it seems like nobody has any idea wtf is going on with the weather so we re told it s a once in a generation event or some other nonsense so we don t freak outwhen will the hyperbolic stop if it not once in a generation it another statistic they pull out of their asses to make an event sound way more epic than it isso what will the floods when this all melts bei been loving seeing the san gabriels snowcappedglobal warming is happening and large swaths of every population are all going to die from it at some point in the next years there is nothing we can do about it we re fucked every single one of us will feel itglobal warming means the polar vortex collapses more often letting cold polar air drift south global warming also means more warm and humid air in the south so we more likely to get extreme snow events with the cold air from the north and the warm and humid air in the south convergingare flash floods a concern as this melts i know soil can be very hydrophobicnot sure if this is feasible but i think our water use needs to be rationed based on who needs it most the state needs to come in and say screw your water rights and then put regulatory limitations to ensure everyone has enough water to by order of priority 1 drink 2 bathe in 3 water crops 4 swim in 5 water lawns if there not enough water for crops bathing and drinking then sorry farmers but i guess your crops will just diei heard that bs before i think it was about a recession or depression or somethingone horse at a time pleaseoh do worry it gon na keep happeningjust a month or so ago everyone was crying about a drought due to climate change now it dumps enough rain and snow to end the drought and it s because of climate change also loldumb californians ca deal with it the canadians are laughing at them they were even warned have no intelligence to prepare for it who does have enough food to last a week cans dry food means there is also gon na be very hot seasons coming upmeanwhile on the east we ll skip winter this yeari love how these one in a generation events keep happening several times a yearall these ones in a generation claims just mean that the people who claim they know what they doing and can predict the future in regards to the climate actually have no ideananha now let watch as those states start trampling the first amendment because potential humans are more important to them than actual living womenhow do i donate to thisthis is literally man what next depive people of contraceptive adsgood education is always warranted give the information away do hoard it as sad as reality is these states have the right to manage their own laws voting and elections have consequences and we living with them because americans did want a woman president instead it elected a serial sex offending fraudster with the worst possible attributes a human could have 50 of you are about to make the same mistake again in 18 months electing the same crook or worse a book burning fascist from floridai been reading up on getting them when not pregnant and having them on hand i do forsee me needing them but i do have a daughter and i already keep plan b on hand considering how the clock is ticking and considering how it more effective when taken earlier she needs it is the time i want to have to frantically search for itstop calling them abortion pillsall those with drug running skills here your chanceis news really just telling us publicly displayed information nowgot ta love how people are desperate to break the law cause they keep spreading their legs for any random dumbass that gives them 5 seconds of attention and is above 6 feet tall and fitnanthis is why you keep a small stockpile especially if you live in the boonies freak things happenthis is why i always have at least a months supply of tinned fish i also just really like tinned fishresidents are expressing growing anger over why officials have not been able to get them out because the roads are covered in impassible amount of snowit is pretty surprising people were prepped i up at an outdoor education center in running springs ca near big bear you have to drive down 30 miles of steep switchbacks that take you from 5000ft to reach redlands and san bernardino at sea level roughly to reach normal sized grocery stores question is are large groups of school kids up there for outdoor ed snowed in with no supplies or access to deliveriesmountain living comes with drawbacks and very real hazardswhy do the residents think if the power goes out their food will go bad can t they just like put it outside in the snow the cold snowi canadian but i not 6 feet of snow canadian i never seen that that insane what do you even dopeople being reminded that living in modern times does not mean you immune to freak events that leave you helplesslot of people in san bernardino have always wanted to secede from california now their chance to be rugged individualistsi feel for these individuals especially the elderly who cant get around too well or shovel tons of snow but preparedness is no joke hope they eventually get dug out so that can find a better sense of peacethis will be a learning lesson for them stock up on non parishable foodhow do you dig out 6 feet of snow when more snow keeps fallingjust to compare when residents up the mountain from ojai ventura co were stranded flash floods ate the roads supplies were helicoptered to the residentsthat what happens when you move to the wildernessthe weather report said it was coming i live in the rockies and i knew the sierras were going to be buried days before they were and it s an area that routinely gets ft storm cyclesby no means am i survivalist or a prepper do they still exist but it s difficult for me to understand the level or urgency here i grew up in new england and live in chicago now my wife used to think it was silly when we first started dating but has come to appreciate that we have in the event of a fire or a serious power outage in the winter or whatever we re pretty much all set if we have to up and stay in a hotel for a week her sister admonished me once and said okay well mike not everyone is as fortunate as you to be able to keep all that stuff on hand but its not like i m readying for the apocalypse its all just basic shit i had and assemblies in one place last i checked my bank account i m not wealthy but i still have lots of canned food a couple of cases of bottled water clean socks and underwear first aid stuff a big power bank extra cash and flashlightssome of those folks should read laura ingalls wilder book the long winter where the ingalls family spent the entire winter of huddled inside their house in desmet dakota territory twisting hay into sticks to burn for heat and using a coffee grinder to make flour for bread and basically little else i not saying these people are weak and i not belittling them but i am suggesting that just being angry that the government is prepared to get to them as quickly as they like after a generational storm is kind of especially if said government had been equipped for this level of event i wonder how many of them would have been wailing about control gubmint spendingreminds me of the family stories of great great grandma and grandpa getting snowed in one winter grandpa took some bread crumbs and tossed them out the upstairs window onto the porch

twinkies meanwhile in turkeyarrowhead sports grill is owned but such nice peopleit not as if these storms were surprises this snowfall was forecast in advance before every storm these people sound the same as people who chose to ride out a hurricane and had their house destroyed while they were in it and then were filmed complaining that the had rescued them yeti ca believe how much i have to scroll down through all the ads just to read this story remember when newspaper articles where easy to readi live in the mountains in idaho i got enough food and water for 90 days plus a years supply of freeze dry food for a full year genny gas water filters so i can get water from the river below me if you can afford a house in the california mountains you can afford a stockpile of food and waterlast spring living in the middle of the capital city of one of the richest countries on the planet i spent ten days without electricity after a derecho tore through i was back at work before i had power back at home i was fortunate in all kinds of ways not least that it was may and not january but you couldn t buy a generator camp stove charcoal or butane for any amount of money within 100km and i m glad i had my camp stove gas and basic supplies for a month on hand butane also keeps better than gasoline picked up a small solar panel and battery toolive in the middle of nowhere do stock emergency supplies we have those here too just let natural selection do its thingthey prayed for rain and snow and got what they asked forgrowing up in the northeast i m well aware that every level of local government needs to keep a small army of snowplows doesn t take a massive genius to realize that your southern ca mountain locality doesn t have the equipment to deal with 8 ft of freak generational snowsheeeeiiit new englanders know to get ready for winter with major stockpiles of water food toilet paper batteries etc so these folks wan na live in pretty mountains and never thought of what that meanspeople who boast about self reliance by living in isolated areas are upset that they are getting helped quick enough during a once in a generation winter yeah ok this is definitely materialnanthe incident took place in 2021 before the constitutional right to abortion was overturned in june 2022 but a warrant was subsequently issued for the woman s arrest in 2022 and she was arrested in february 2023 sgt jonathan bragg of the greenville police department confirmed well that is fucked upso we officially stepped into the handmaid talethe party of freedom now literally fasciststhey are coming for your contraception nextwell here we this will be the first of many outlawing or criminalizing abortion does make it go away this is what you get when you vote for the gop if you do like it then either abstain or vote for a democrat if you still vote for republicans and want to complain about this you need to shut the fuck up because this is what you get i am really not a person that carry around hatred but i sorry i hate these fucking people there is a tried and true way to reduce abortion rates and these fucking dunce king clowns are against all of that too the gop is the party of idiots small my fucking asshole how can you claim to be for small government and freedom when you set up a massive and costly government bureaucracy to police a basic human right that goes back millenia fuck all these people go live in pakistan or saudi arabia if you want to live under a theocracyred states need child labor to clean up their slaughterhouses they ca afford to allow any women the right to manage her own body average maga supporteryet another state to avoidholy fucking shit and cue the refugees god damnhow do you prove someone took a pill fuck these asshatsrepublicans will tell you what to do with your uterus retroactivelycould biden in theory just have a pardon waiting for herkilling roe was a bad idea for the crowd roe had significant restrictions on abortion in the second and third trimester now there are no restrictions if a state so desiresso is i nut i commit premature abortionthe crime here is that she was stupid enough to admit to a crime spontaneously at the hospital rather than exercising her right to say nothing at allremember talking to a woman who had a miscarriage while living in soviet romania and she was arrested on suspicion of trying to abort a pregnancy these lawmakers are vileif her name gets made public we can set up a fund for hershe was 25 weeks that s over six months sc allows abortion up to 20 weeks i m pro choice so don t bombard me just pointing out the factsafter reading the article it seems like the woman waited too long to pursue an abortion and took matters into her own hands by self medicating to get an abortion despite it being illegal to do so in that state even before roe v wade was overturnedthis is probably going to get downloaded into oblivion but what this woman did is a crime in basically every state in the country even in california you can not have a voluntary abortion after the fetus is viable which is around 24 weeks this woman self induced her abortion at 25 weeks when you look at the facts it certainly appears that she did break the law herewhen did it become illegalbetter lynch her ass to show how we arenanthis might be a thing if the people in charge of these decisions were held accountable but we all know that they are not so it not a thingmost railroad workers are fighting against an entire system that only exists as a apparatus to the wealthy those trains run through our towns but they do not run next to rich folks homes nor next to our politicians homes this is a beautifully saidno one wants to people work nowadays smhand not a goddamned thing will be doneeventually this kind of corporate neglect will affect the whole country if it has not already right or this has been happening forever but due to the quick spread of info though soc media and other media we are now seeing the magnitude of negligence i also read somewhere that there is an estimated 2 train chem spills a week on average my question is will the residence be treated for now and future medical issuesand they will pay whatever slap on the wrist fine they get hit with and would rather take the fine than pay keep going bc that fine is cheaper than the fix just like edward norton says in fight club that car companies knew about some malfunction or issue that was like a bad problem that was killing people the car company literally said it was cheaper to pay the lawsuits from that consumers next of kin fines by government than issue a recallwhen i was a child my parents would punish me if i did something wrong it would be so great if we had a policy like that for adultsi do understand how the rail industry reached this state obviously deregulation and corruption my statement is more one of disbelief in my industry safety professionals are some of the and most influential members of any organization because of the value they impart to that organization it not just about fines and lost revenue if your company has enough osha recordable incidents the entire thing will be shut down does matter if it a shop or a dollar international conglomeraterail company better save that seven billion they were going to give themselves as bonuses and stock buybacks and put it into the settlement for the coming lawsuits from the community they just erasednani know someone who prescribed mifepristone when she suffered a miscarriage in lieu of a much more

dots for eyes this is why i not a jurorwhen they were leading him out of the court the camera panned and showed all the jurors lolpure evil this man takes pathological lying to the next level and he killed his wife and son in cold blood i hope he fucking rotsprosecutors argued that murdaugh killed his wife and son in a desperate effort to distract attention from his financial crimes and gain sympathy from the community holy shit i knew it was pretty obvious he did it but that motive is next levelhe admitted under questioning that he had lied to investigators when he denied being at the estate that night blaming his lies on his addiction to opioids his attorneys said his drug habits cost a week i don t care how much money you have i can t comprehend how you could possibly put 50k of drugs in your body a week and survivei had a hunch the case was going to be taken seriously when they took down the framed painting of his grandpa which hung on the wall behind the judges chairsentencing tomorrow athe was dumb to testify he got too arrogantgood fuck him he s a goddamn psychopathglad he s finally fucked sick of him and his family making the area worse off for generationsgod bless mallory beach that poor child s death led to alex s unraveling not that maggie or paul deserved what he did but mallory gloria and stephen were true innocentsthe whole family was doing some creepy stuff they had everything and threw it all awayit only took the jury 3 hours to return a guilty verdict after a 6 week trial this trial could have been an the jury probablyhis face as they read the verdict was that of somebody who got caughtjustice prevailed today in my opinion no doubt but i must say i am shocked that a verdict was delivered so quickly the prosecution did a great job of assassinating alex s character by methodically laying out all of the lies and deceit alex had spewed but most of their evidence was circumstantial and shaky the smoking gun of this case was the video his son paul took just minutes before the murder that put alex at the scene of the murders in those kennels had that video not been taken i doubt the prosecution had zilch for their case that would lead to this conviction well done to the prosecution team the judge who was patient fair throughout the lengthy process and the jurors for sticking it throughyeah that shit was obvious dude fucking did it anyone who murders especially murders their family are fucking scumin other news five broadcast networks have a total of 356 hours of news to fill over the next two days because they thought deliberations would take longerwhy did he as an experienced lawyer talk lie so much to the copsthis guy has clearly gone through life thinking he could get away with anything and managed it until that june even with the shoddy investigation shoddy mostly because they were clearly intimidated by him or just didn t think he could possibly be guilty for so long there was never any evidence of anyone else being there to commit those murders i wonder though if the verdict would have been different if 1 he hadn t decided to testify he came across as rehearsed arrogant and insincere 2 he hadn t had his friends represent him it became apparent they were very involved in the aftermath and thus alex s untruthfulness and i think that muddied things with the jury 3 jim s closing statement hadn t been so terrible it was a rebuttal not a proper closing he sounded nervous and unsure really with pretty much all the evidence being circumstantial it should have been easy to instil doubt he did a shockingly bad jobjust read the wiki on this dude holy fuck sure are a whole lot of people dying around you alexyep real obvious just from that video his voice was on 5 minutes before their death and said for months he was therehis eyes are all pupilthe whole family was rotten fuck em allit sure looks like court tv showed the jury live on television when they walked him out of the room he walked past what sure looked like the jury box filled with people shown on tv then as the judge was dismissing the jury he was facing the direction that was just shown finally when court tv was doing the network anchor interviews one of them said that murdaugh was escorted past the jury who just convicted him so sure seems like the identities of all of them were just exposed horrifying if that s the case i sure hope it s not and that there s a better explanation there are video replays of this out d share one but that d just be contributing to the problem of showing their identitieshe definitely did that shitsays his family has been high up in the legal and justice side of carolina for decades and decades seems like entitlement and now i have to wonder what his father grandfather and great grandfather have gotten away with50k a week drug habit these people really deserve to have their wealth taxedwhy does this guy and his whole family look like a bunch of squinting sunburned pigs they re such bizarre looking creaturesnot that surprising saw his testimony admits to lying to police and yet exudes the confidence and contempt of the 1this absolute dipshit got on the stand and testified and ended up with more charges because of it just dessertsthis is one of the craziest cases ever i ca wait to read the bookcongrats to the jury for having eyes and earsi have a feeling this dude is going to kill himselfthis is literally the first i ve heard of any of this and i have no idea who this guy is but the threads in here suggest an incredible tale worthy of yellowstone s writers room complete with and a boat accident that brought the family to its got ta read up on this nowrumor is he tried to change his name to alex manslautah before the trialthe undisputed turning point of this case was this guy taking the stand he now serves as an eternal reminder to all future defendants especially in a case as big as this not to take the standlookin forward to never having to hear about this jackass ever againmurdaugh by name murder by naturethis man just destroyed his family s legacy in southi been following this trial pretty closely and i honestly shocked the jury came back so fast they only started deliberations a few hours ago watching the trial there was a lot of stuff that was royally fucked up by the original investigating team for example the coroner determined the time of death by sticking his hands in the armpits of the victims which as you might surmise is entirely unscientific and improper so there was never a precise time of death another example is that they did secure the entire scene after the murders alex had dozens of people at his house the next day and the crime scene unit had to work around the people in the house i thought this would be a hung jury or at least take several days of deliberationsometimes the system works yay i hope all of the ppl he swindled get their money back and i hope he lives a very long life behind barsi lived in south carolina near hilton head and beaufort for a year i was working full time i heard about this and was like oh okay people were legitimately scared of him but what i also found out is he not the only one if you think this is crazy you the wild one apparently in sc there several people like this and it terrifying to live in sc because if everyone makes every one dissappear look up the two people couple who also disappeared but was never found sc is like the home of rich people making people dissappeari was legitimately worried he wouldn t be found guilty even when it s so obvious damnout in the streets they call it murdaughi cast william h macythe housekeeper pissed me off more for some reason just doing her job and feeling part of a family one wrong word and nightmurdaugh pronounced in just the right wayit turns out that i was so high that i don t remember being at the crime scene screaming at the victims and i couldn t have killed them because i was busy with all my other felonies isn t an airtight defensejust insane that paul essentially was the one to help solve his own murder i feel like he took that video knowing something was up which is brilliant he was a terrible human being but he learned that from alex maggie didn t seem like a good person either but she died wanting to help her son and that breaks my heart my heart is will mallory s family todayhe looks like he was carved out of a wooden stump that wants to kill his wife and soni ve seen way too many cases where a person would sooner kill off their entire family than just own up to something shameful or go through a divorce i do not understand their thought process they just take a bad situation and make it infinitely worse not to mention it only draws even more attention to the thing they were trying to hide in the first placegood the guy is 100 trashgood what a sociopathic posray charles could have seen that comingthe lie is a nail in the coffin for anyone thinking its bad but not that bad that means even if he was innocent which hes not that would mean he been lying to police about the circumstances of his families death and hiding details for two years that may have helped them find the true killer which does exist cause its him is just far too ilogicalwhacked out opioid addiction wife was on him about that wanted a divorce he was going down for embezzlement no matter what the time line with location data about where he was at time of murders and the admission of lying about everything even if he didn t do the murders prison is still a perfect place for himtoo bad he was found out he would ve done brilliantly in national politics so glad the jury was able to see the obviousnanto get around us sanctions prosecutors say buyanovsky and robertson concealed who their clients were lied about how much products cost and were paid through foreign bank accounts probably should have started with a name change firsttwo us nationals were arrested in

airplanes according to prosecutors and allegedly sold equipment to russian companies and provided repair services for russian aircrafts to get around us sanctions prosecutors say buyanovsky and robertson concealed who their clients were lied about how much products cost and were paid through foreign bank accounts not a very good job of concealing there geniuses i wonder what tipped off the investigorsanyone in the us supporting russia in their invasion of ukraine are traitorsthose dash garmin gps units are cutting edge tech for the russian air force they should have just ordered from

americans addicted for working with russia about important projects you can t undo everything the fbi will hunt them downhopefully their sentence is to fight on the front line in ukraine either the russians or ukraine will get themand here i expected it to be a couple garmin gpsnanthat poor family article says they were sanitizing the pump parts although sometimes moist but still ended up contaminated with cronobacterthe infant was premature and if i reading correctly being fed at least partially through a that changes the risk level and baby ability to fight infection substantially i not sure what kind of pump it was to be completely disassembled or if that just wording of the article and it was a closed system which is safer i get that people are going to harp on this family for the sanitation aspect and i just want to add context this was a preemie with special feeding needs likely parents with limited to no paid time off to care for this child and what they did have was likely burned up while the baby was still in the nicu dad is probably back at work and the bulk of the work falling on mom if she is pumping pending baby age she could be doing that every two hours sanitization takes time and recommendations vary i not sure what their nicu team advised but hot soapy water for the flanges duckbills backflow protectors and bottles is generally safe some recommend running through the dishwasher on a sanitize cycle now i said mom may be pumping every two hours that 24 hours a day and the setup and time to pump is about 30 minutes now she needs to clean if she washes by hand that another 10 minutes air dry time if it by dishwasher that much longer by the time you are done pumping you not that far off from the next scheduled pump if you have multiple sets of parts for your pump that helps but it money you may not have or maybe during your 2am pump you realized you did wash your 12am parts and so you hurriedly wash them sanitize them and try to dry with a towel but are still a bit damp as you reassemble and pump so you can try to get some sleep before you are up again at 4 or maybe mom is back at work too and having to store parts in the fridge between pumps and no where to lay out the tubing to get air in between pumps my guess is this is some kind of open system pump may be the only kind insurance would cover that got some moisture or condensation in the tubing which you are typically not to sanitize and takes a long time to dry out i could see that then potentially contaminating the parts they were sanitizing due to baby circumstances something that a full term orally fed baby could probably ward off became lethal to this one just a horrible tragedyoh my god that heartbreaking it was probably one of those more complex electrical pumps the tubes on those things are harder to properly sanitize and dry out i never bothered with those out of fear of not being able to clean them right and used hand pumps instead but yeah always make sure the parts are completely dried before reassembling anything to do with food prepchrist and i just now buying this kind of stuff for my soon to be kidi read the article no the baby did not die after being literally tied to a breast pumphow awful for this poor family what a loss i run a ministry for infants and distribute goods to low income families people often donate used breast pumps and equipment which is so expensive to buy new i just can not bring myself to give it away and sadly it goes into the trash this reinforces my instinctsdeleteddeletedremovedi guess common sense is a thing of the pastnanas a resident i witnessed this first hand 1 lab tech overnight for a 450 bed hospital need a timely lab done to manage your critically ill patient overnight you may get it some time tomorrow if you are lucky hope your patient doesn t die actually we don t care as long as they have insurance hca admin are literally some of the worst humans on the planetby the employees the people giving care they would know more than anyonethis will always happen when the primary motivation is profit over patient care health care in the usa makes obscene amounts of money but providers act like providing service to match that cost is too much of a burden really they are structured such that the fewer staff do a job the higher manager bonuses are there is a perverse incentive to short care regulators do do anything about it they all end up working for the industries they regulatenot an accusation factthe same hca that current florida senator rick scott was ceo of and at that time oversaw the largest medicare fraud in history he plead the 5th 75 times while being deposed httpsaccept less profit and pay your front line workers more or get nationalized and lose everythingi refuse to go to any hca run facility fuck these greedy bastardsahh yes the same people who lobby to lower safety standards like making it so an attending can oversee 14 that coolthis is nothing new back in the the local hca got the brilliant idea to assign an rn to patients with the assurance that all they have to do was assessments interventions and charting an lvn would pass meds and the aides would do all the hand on care of course they did hire enough people to make this work and this nonsense ended when a patient was critically injured due to deliberate i believe the nurse had 20 patients total and the family sued the hospital the only thing hca cares about is making moneyhca is highly profitable last year it earned billion and its stock is an investor from another article i can grab the link to if curiousi just quit my job at hca for much of the same reason they expected us to do the work load of multiple people and we did if only out of survival instinct the job needed to be done and they refuse to give us help to do it so we had to learn how to do it ourselves the jobs were not done correctly but from the outside it looked like it was many of my quit and at two different periods in a year i was left working by myself for a month at a time our team was supposed to have nine people in it it was only when i threatened to quit that they started looking for additional help the additional help they brought in had no experience doing the job but they were offered 7 more an hour as an incentive to work because hca is also one of the lowest paying companies in the field when i learned that all of my that i was training we being paid significantly more than i was i asked for a raise and was denied i finally had enough and left i now getting text messages from my boss offering me more money to come back it turns out my boss is never learned how to do my job so now nobody knows how to do my job that place is hot and garbage and i will never go back thereformer hca employee here i took an rn job there when i first moved to florida and lasted exactly 5 shifts before i accepted that the staffing would always be awful and quit patients deserve betterfor profit should be illegal in prisons healthcare and schools there should be safe staffing ratios for healthcare schools and prisonsi bet they do have a staffing issue at the administrative leveldang i keep getting recruiting emails from themthis is what happens when the state mandates for staffing count all licensed staff in the building toward the total giving care nevermind 5 nurses are required but 3 are sitting on their ass in a conference room watching tiktok and complaining their salary is enough for this there were 5 rns in the building we good on paper patients even know it after a while oh state must be here i see office staff making beds and my breakfast was cold todayi work for another provider that does the same thingnanmy one question is why the epa directing the perpetrator to do all the testing and cleanup they need to have a third party or parties do the testing and cleanup ns has too much power and away over this whole thing of course ns should pay for all of iti tried putting myself in these residents shoes and i just ca even begin to imagine what they going through we have a railway that runs through our town many of us do with norfolk being the bulk of the traffic there no telling if or when this will happen to any of us fuck norfolk southern they do give a fuck except for the bottom line regulate these assholes and all railways so this does happen againthis whole thing is asinine the amount of protection for corps and businesses is disgustingresidents votes for gop corporate shills corporate shills shills to corporate by deregulating

of cancer is to cut it out amputatesheriff robert luna said in a statement friday that he was elected in november to bring new leadership and accountability to this department and thanked the commission for its work but stopped short of committing to immediately ban the the one thing that needs to be done he won t commit to doingthere will be the equivalent of crips and bloods in all major metropolitan police department soon vying for power trampling citizens rights and making a mockery of the rule of law kind of like what they do now just under different colorhad two cop friends my former best and his friend do really have a problem with the latter was in cali for a wedding we were driving around and his friend was joking but also clearly serious that the lapd is basically a gang and above the law neither of them work for lapd i need to be truthful i mean it was slightly prompted by my questions but moreso a continuation of the argument i been having with my bff since he considered becoming a cop in early 2011 before ferguson even we got back to his house later and we arguing and the other friend was going into greater detail about the issue and my bff coldly and sternly rebuked him do tell him any more about police work he not one of us also incorrectly assumed i voted for hillary clinton anyway that pretty much says all you need to know about thati take no shit sherlock for a hundred alexhey i seen this one beforeprobably not a great idea to recruit from white supremacist prison gangscan cancers get cancersso too is the department itselfnansounds like he was trying to smuggle in freedom for his peoplei guess they didn t have any unoccupied windows to throw him out ofsounds like fabricated or at least highly exaggerated evidencebut they dont have oil so we wouldnt ever interferenanthat s mississippi last in everythingopponents said it would betray conservative principles lol like conservative principles is actually a thingit would have been nice if ap told us what these restrictions entailmaybe we should get rid of the laws for regular dealerships instead it would be nice to be able to buy a car as easily as a teslai thought republican wanted less regulation and more free enterprise eli5 how does this fit with conservative principleswe re saying if you choose to have a dealership you have to follow the same laws that everyone else has to follow sparks said please don t tell me tesla s car doesn t identify as a had me in the first halfbut but but small governmentthe whole car selling system is ridiculously outdated instead of making ev makers adhere to it it should be abandoned it makes sense that i can go to a dealership that sells identical types of cars instead of having to go to multiple dealerships to see their range of cars separately in those typeselon is getting fucked by the same people he said everyone should be voting forisn t capitalism supposed to allow businesses to fail when a more preferred business model becomes prevalent wow it s almost like capitalism isn t what the entrenched rich really want after allhow totally not surprising their capital city has had drinkable water in 8 months except for governor tate reeves of course he had a nice tanker car outside the governors mansion and then there these stats 50 in poverty rate 50 in education rate 38 in violent crime 45 in drug usea very misleading headline it not restricting ev sales as such it is restricting them to car dealerships same restrictions that exists for gas cars tesla was already fighting this fight in other states it not uncommon for states to restrict car sales to dealership prohibiting direct sales from car manufacturers there are historical reason why this is so in the us in short for all the bad reasons there are really no good reasons to give preferences to dealerships vs manufacturers what this bill is actually about to bypass existing laws tesla opened a store not a dealership this bill apparently simply closes whatever loophole tesla used to classify their store as a store instead of as dealership basically leveling the playing field between tesla and other more traditional car companies fwiw tesla is well known to insist on direct sales and does want to engage into classic dealership model the rest of the industry is using imo they simply got it backwards with this bill instead of removing dealership requirements and allowing direct sales of any car they are attempting to force tesla and other new automakers to open dealership franchises instead one can only assume a lot of money in the form of campaign donations from dealerships is about to exchange hands as part of this bill being passedi thought america was pro free marketi love how government can mean so many different thingsplz explain to me how legislating the requirement that prohibits direct sales to customers is a good thinghow that new twitter audience working out for you elonthis is a pretty bad headline the bill is actually a franchise protection bill and not an anti ev bill basically you ca buy directly from a company like you can with tesla or polestar you now have to buy vehicles via dealerships and only dealerships it still pretty but my guess is that those dealership lobbyists paid someone a lot of money to get this through when they noticed that competition like tesla was starting to outcompete themlol let turn our clocks back 70 years toocause mississippi to fall behind other states oops too late to take credit for thathey look free market capitalismread the damn article peopleeven alabama has put a lot into promoting electric cars because they re built here but don t you dare put solar on your houseparty of small government and the free market when it suits themhey now we don t need none of those fancy ass new opportunities around here look how well we re doing with absolutely nothing going for us tbh the plight of my home state is something i ve grown accustomed to since birth apparently we don t understand how the people we elect have continued to plunder the state so we just keep electing the same old crooks looking at you tater facethe party of small government strikes againshould the free markets decide or is that only when it goes the conservatives wayparty of small government and the government shouldn t regulate private industries peoplei wonder how many car dealerships are republican campaign contributorswait the mississippi that s 49th out of 50 states in education the one that s 1st out of 50 states in poverty rates the one that s 49th out of 50 states in standard of living 45th in lowest population with health insurance 5th in most adults with either fair or poor health that mississippihow very market exactly in line with conservative valuesproud to be backwards these are the same states that made it economically punitive to free slaves before the civil wari thought capitalism was supposed to have a economy using state powers to restrict private citizens from purchasing goods services sounds an awful lot like that thing they been complaining about for like a half centurysmall government conservativesthe title is misleading they re requiring the sale of electric cars to operate under the same restrictions in place for gas vehicle dealerships i don t know if those rules are unreasonable or notmississippi gon na mississippimisleading title and story this has nothing to do with ev ice autos it has everything to do with direct retail franchised dealershipssomething something party of small governmentfree market capitalismcar dealerships are an unnecessary middleman we can not let these useless laws propping up a bad business model be applied to electric cars too don t forget that your local dealership is the one that jacked up prices even after the manufacturers said not tolet be honest nobody in mississippi can afford an electric vehiclethat ok tesla sells direct and does have dealershipsf king morons what possible good does such a move do other than continue to make the state a pariahmaybe worry about having the lowest life expectancy in the country insteadfrom the folks who claim to hate big governmenti do understand why conservatives are so afraid of electric carsdoes mississippi even have 1 electric carjust let these dumb fuck states stay behind the curve while the rest of us progress if they want to willingly stagnate themselves or regress let themnext week they re tackling the plague that is fresh vegetablesi sure love small governmentthe party of small government and personal freedom strikes againdealership owners spend a lot on local politicians they do want to be left out in the future but it coming and it coming fastnow if that not small government i do know what isthis is mississippi refusing to let florida take over as the dumbestbackward state says whaton one hand it seems a bit sensible to close a loophole tesla exploited to say their store is a storefront and not a dealership on the other hand i feel like it s funny republicans are pushing more laws when they rant about small government and that this was probably done because republicans just hate any attempt to improve the world bonus funnies over the gop fucking over elon when he s been carrying their torch with his twitter shitswear the south wants to go back to the 1950 so badlygop out here solving the realsupply side jesus would be rolling in his tombhow close is mississippi to banning central heating electric lighting anybodymeh just shows my shares are gon na go way the fuck up in the next ten or eighty but then my hypothetical kids won t have to worry of that s the casewhat a backwards shitholewhat a bunch of toolstroglodytes all stunningcan we just let mississippi secede from the usso these dumb asses don t think that perhaps the business model is outdated no they will go above and beyond to keep status quo idk how people live in places like mississippi with no hope of evolving into a normal place to livestates to avoid 100 mississippi florida texas missouri idaho got itdumbing down of amercian citizens it been in style for a while nowlobbying at its finest because it s not a smart idea it s actually very stupidthey are going back to the stone agesthat doesn t sound like loving republicanism or job creation sounds like insert repressive regime buzzwords the republicans lovefree market republicanism at workthis is too rich too rich to believe gop politicians are actually going against the very principles that are the bedrock of conservatism they are their own worst enemy what investor would build a company in a state that can suddenly decide it wants to regulate how you do business in their no one that s who if there s a strategy here i fail to see it anyone want to take a crack at explaining what the gop strategy is heremississippi is going to be like cuba in a few ancient cars and cannibalizing parts gon na just be a state of hoopdedoosmississippi the state that got the crap kicked out of it by hurricane katrina and that was 2005 we now yrs down the road from how many more disasters have they had visited upon them since 2005 and this is their incredibly intelligent response to climate change way to go you backwards southern rethuglicanssadly this is not a new concept many states mine included have had laws on the books for decades protecting the car dealer from being skipped over in the car buying process job security mandated by lawremember when these guys wanted small governmentthe party of small government and deregulationone step forward 10 steps backah those republicans sure love the free market do theyi said this before but it bears repeating republicans are basically captain planet villainsit forces electric to have a dealership mode like traditional autos but really the dealership model is what needs to gopretty sure the people of mississippi didn t originally push for that bill wonder what industry bought a politician for thatred states continue to hold the usa backparty of freedom helping their rich friendswe hate government conservatives continue to add government policies to keep everything their way also conservatives but hey electric cars mean less gas money also mean less health issues due to pollution in thei guess they got ta keep the clique about the south being full of stupid idiots alive and wellmaybe we just like being last all the time maybe it s a badge of honor we re the last ones to change fillingane said if we re not careful we could deprive our citizens of opportunities they really ought not to be deprived never noticed the gop cared about this at allthe usa sure has an odd take on freedomwhy are they so proud of being ignorantman i feel sorry for my normal gop friends there party is in full collapse thanks to illiterate members and legacy thinking and values way to ban ev dealerships that don t follow traditional car dealerships which most of americans want way to reduce your future and future tax dollars keep it upwe are going to have to drag them into the 21st century kicking and screaming the whole wayrepublicans will always stand in the way of progresssuper disingenuous headlinebrett farve bribing local government againthis will be hilarious in 20 years when the only gas cars are super carsrepublicans are such a sad groupmomma says we ain t got no time for no book learninthe title is misleading it not restricting electric car dealerships it asking them to follow the same rules ie state fees that auto dealerships have to follow it just another example of elon musk skirting the rules to further his bottom line he allowed to list his business as a and not an auto dealership that just dumb and it looks like this politician is trying to close the loopholethe mississippi senate gave final approval thursday to a bill to restrict electric car manufacturers from opening new dealerships in the state unless they comply with the same laws traditional carmakers follow not even bothering to read the story i seeitt people not reading the article bill is to make electric car dealers follow the same rules as every other car dealership idk what those rules are but at first blush that sounds completely reasonable to meso can the dealerships sue this law as unfair conservatives sure love to talk about small government till they need to use it as a weaponi m surprised that mississippi hasn t restricted the construction of indoor plumbing and home electricityi don t see this as bad as it sounds they re not restricting electric car dealerships anymore than conventional dealerships they re just applying the same rules tesla was skirting dealership laws by playing quick and loose with the definition of store and this just closes that loophole it also pretty much only affects companies like tesla and rivian since other car companies that sell electric cars like hyundai would already be subject to the normal dealership lawsbackwards republican shit holepeople trying hard to take everyone backwardpetroleum lobby dollars in actioni mean madicinal marijuana is legal in ms and that the devil weed they figure at some point electricity is magic coming through wiresone mississippi two mississippi last mississippiit s shocking to think of the level of damage consistently conservative leadership can have on a statehahahaha the south is full of ass clowns ahahhahahathird world shit holelol like anyone in mississippi can afford most evsmississippi is what i like to call an aggressively stupid statemississippi another state that takes the more in government funding then it contributes to americai knew it d be a ridiculous article after reading the word mississippi in the titlei really don t care about them we ve never depended on mississippi for anything it ll just become a state no one ever drives through cuz they can t charge their carsso these politicians either are paid by big oil or they are just really stupid both are not what is needed who keeps on voting these people inmississippi sucks for sure but this headline is disingenuous from the article they want the electric car dealerships to play by the same rules as other dealerships currently telsa is registered as a retail store and not a car dealership thereby evading the same i was prepared to be outraged but ended up thinking this is a good thingovertly challenging progress and putting our future generations in greater peril fucking human filth i hope they all get cancer and die horriblymississippi is another world idiot sanctuarythe actions of poor uneducated conservativeswe re backwards and would like to go backwardsermore of that small government leadership ehhonestly how can people be against clean energy what i mean is how can someone justify being against it it like the definition of being against something just cause it the right thing to dowho really gives a crap about mississippilmao this can t last longthey have masters to serveway to go idiots focus on the real problems of this worldi literally ordered my tesla online didn t need a

deprived nothing says mississippi more than this statementi do understand this here in the uk where i from they banning the sale of combustion engines from 2030 and forcing us to drive electric cars i think this is awful the government should be taking away our personal choice however on the other side why the fuck would the government try and stop people from making the personal choice to buy an electric vehicle i literally do understand it at allaaah republicans they will die b4 they allow progressplease don t tell me teslas cars don t identify as got a little jab at trans people in therenew state motto striving for mediocritywhat a wildly misleading title all the bill does is say they have to play by the same exact rules traditional car manufacturers must follow in the state sounds fair enough to mewhat happened to free marketthe us has practically banned ice vehicles by 2035 and they just banned evdo they realize that ford will not have any dealerships for there ev loleven if there is no restriction on electric car dealership mississippi is one of the poorest state in the union look at what happened to state capitol jackson mississippi when the water pipe burst and residents were forced boil water for a while the state just does not have money and their cops are one of the lowest paid in the nationnankind of ironic how there currently two top posts on this sub about 31 year old women sexually assaulting boys one had the boy child and is receiving no jail time while this one is having the book thrown at hergrabbing somebody genitals through their clothes is sexual assault this is stalking grooming and sexual intercourse with a minor of which you had a position of authority over as a school employee considering the details of the rape are public you may as well just call it rape you not protecting the victim just obfusicating the crime to the skimmersremovedmy lunch lady looked like john candyremovedoh great she qualifies to work in the prison kitchen

the conservatives that always comment oh man that kid is so lucky when i was a kid i always wanted that to happen to me i seen tons of comments like that on other news sites let have a conversation about who is grooming whonew fairfield is a shit hole and i not super surprised it effectively a bunch of poor uneducated racist white people who are on meth and think they live in the rural southsloppy joe slop sloppy joe yeahremovedremovedso he willingly left a party to have sex with the cafeteria lady who looks like that and he has a bunch of unsolicited porn of her i call bs on the unsolicited porn and bs on him not wanting to keep screwing the woman he lost his virginity to her it not happening is it sexual abuse absolutely she needs to see the inside of a jail cell for an extended stay however that relationship was about as as a sphere i guess i also guess the kid had more sex than he letting on with the defendant whenever and wherever he could find 19 secondsman i wish i had this type of release as a horny school age kidthe term lunch lady is ridiculous in most cases it s degrading and in her case it s meant to make her sound like an innocent old woman stop

me of the incidences of kids yelling build the wall at minorities kids will do fucked up shit and the adults need to set a better example trying to push some politics narrative with this story is exactly what furthers these types of fractureswhat a confused generationi use to be all about privacy now i feel we should have cameras everywhereseems like a crisis outside the classroom as opposed to the titlethis whole situation is sad i could hope that it doesn t lead to more hate and more violence but that s sadly the way the world worksdeletedbroken ass website one of the worst i ever seenthere a difference between saying black lives matter and black lives matter it a shame so few people can recognize that nobody should be forced into supporting any group or organization regardless of the message they pretend to represent either way it truly disgusts me to my core to see people pretend to represent racial inequality while acting out supremacy at least the kkk and white supremacist groups do try to pretend they represent equality they let you know full stop they represent supremacy really hope these kids get the punishment and ridicule they deserve edit if ya gon na downvote have the balls to say whycrt isn t being taught in schoolswow the republican outrage machine is so desperate to find oppression that they have to resort to stalking elementary school children

assholerythis is fox new entertainment do believe anything they say even if a video is involved they spin shit to target people with mental illnessesi do condone violence in any way in schools and if

cocainemoney is a gateway drugtime for the christmas specialdeletednancan and will are two different thingsis the justice department also aware that it can file chargestrump facing consequences is the mainstream version of qanon any day now any day nowthen do it i soooo sick of hearing they could the justice department suggests so and so says he could be initiated he should be in jail yes he should be just throw the book at him for god sakeblah blah blah more if the same horse shit every other month it s clear trump is in fact above the law and nothing will come his way regarding the attempted coup under his watch call me pedantic or a doomer whatever you want but one thing that s certain is trump will never see the inside of a jail cell let alone face any sort of repercussions for his wrongdoingsbasically passing the buck the justice department will not speak to trump responsibility to causing the riots but you all can try and sue him if you want the joker has influenced the judges againcrazy how rich influential people can try to overthrow the government and destroy an election yet get to roam free for years after insanity we ll probably never recover from the damage trump caused the division is wider than everthat would be awesome if he actually had any moneyah the obvious compromise we won t indict because we re spineless but you can sue the dude who has plenty to spend on lawyers what a jokehalf the country believes mogul actor and former president donald trump should die in jail and the other half believes he had a second term stolen from him what a time to be aliveappointing merrick garland is probably the worst thing biden has done in his presidencywait police can sue citizens but we ca sue them tfcan i file charges because all of this has sucked for me on a personal level several meals and moments of my life not enjoyed i pretty sure my brains literally leaked out of my ear listening to him speak i feel some restitution is in order for everyoneget ready for the end of times the republicans are gon na setup trump so that he can t run in 2024 trump is about the sell everyone up river to be president again popcorns timesued fuck that lock him upsometimes i think i overly worrying about it all the maga and conservative shit like maybe each generation gets up in arms about something however while watergate was nefarious and a huge deal where nixon left office this was a coup attempt on our country and nothing has been done to the leader of that coup it crazy how bad it is now so then i wonder if this is the worst thing that happened to our country and that i not actually overly worryingwasn t a lot of police waving them inbelieve it when i see itcivil is bullshit it will take years he wo pay even when he loses where the hell are the imminent charges from georgia im so tired of thissince day one of his presidency an article has come out daily stating something about this man from investigations probes inquiries russiagate documents legitimate concerns or criminal activity and even outright lies i heard again and again this time we got him it the end for trump we need more time etc etc for anyone still holding their breath just breathe i implore you it just not gon na happenthe question is will they do ithow does this work can a police officer sue me for me damaging their fingers when they punch me i know these are two different circumstances but how are specifically the police allowed to sueah the obvious compromise we won t indict because we re spineless but you can sue the dude who has plenty to spend on lawyers what a joketaking a rich persons pocket change isn t justicewill he no can he certainlyat this point who is suing trumpi can almost hear lumpy now so unfair so unfairthe doj needs to be overhauled if they can not follow the law and bring charges against trump their inactivity is unethical and violates their oath of office this is such a case of clear liabilityand not a damn thing will happen to him they dok but will trump be indicted by anyone ever edit worddear conservatives remember to breathe once in a while screaming whataboutisms can really get you winded if you not careful try yogalmao have fun with 300 different lawsuits assholeeveryone can sued trump but no one wants tojust imagine the discoveryredditors really just reading the title lol read the whole article even if they allow the suit to come forward it s unlikely to go anywhere because a it would set a bad precedent and b its incredibly unlikely for them to successfully fulfill the requirements of proving intent the only real leg they have to stand on is that because of his public reach you could argue he should be held to a higher standard but then that would set precedent for other public figures that routinely scream rhetoric such as burning jk rowling at the stake yeah probably not something the courts will want to set in stone as much as redditors love to scream corruption people should consider the consequences of this passingthis was not on my 2023 bingo card but a welcome surprise i guessthey wo charge their heros it what they inspire to be if they charge them they themselves can be charged later not going to happen integrity has left the usa a loooooong time agomaxine waters starting to quiveris anything gon na happencan could would should fucking do it or shut the fuck up already we ve been hearing this for tooooooo longthen let me know when it actually donecan trump once again file for bankruptcy before the case comes to courtdo hold your breath for a positive outcome 2 tiered courts in the united statesso fucking charge himpolice you mean the guys who opened the doors and let the protestors insupreme court no they cai am tired of seeing trump can trump would trump could trump should when will something actually happen to this guy instead of until then all these articles are bullshit fluff with no real substance this does go for just trump either but a majority of the people in the news headlines lately rules for thee but not for me aka the peasantspolice should be able to sue trump for his actions and people should be able to sue police for their actions i don t have a problem with police suing people i do have a problem with police feeling they should have the right to sue people and then hiding behind qualified immunity when they are the ones in the wrong and are at risk of being suedwe can not indict a presidential candidate bs mouthpiece probsalso every single january 6th insurrectionist who incurred charges jail time legal bills should sue fox news too they were lied to and unfortunately the credulous rubes believed itit a rare day i find myself siding with the police but here we are i hope they take him to the cleanerswhy is this criminal still a presidential candidate wtf is wrong with americai would like that headline a whole lot more if it said will be sueddoes that mean police can sue anyone one suspected of inciting unrest looking at you protestors and shopliftersnow to find a cop who not a trump supporter sighwell ya he is to blame for all or itlove how everyone thinks that the doj should arrest trump as if this is a law order episode if you really want things to go faster a protest or hell even a strongly worded letter to the government would do more work than the outrage you guys are doing on reddit want things done do something about itruby and shaye the capitol police and many more to come hopefully these lawsuits will chase trump til the day he drops deadhe reach out to his followers to pay the settlement make more than he owes and keep the rest just like he done with his legal expenses put this asshole in prison that still getting off light for treasonyou ca get blood from an orangecivil law the only thing that has a chance of affecting the aristocracy it wo be justice but if he gets hurt by it i all in favor of itcan we sue the police for failing to protect children at a school shootingwhat if the police believe in right wing bullshit will they still sue himtime to file a lawsuit on behalf of all americans who are magathey been trying to bust the don since he was in office wake me up when it happensi love how desperate you all are for trump to go to prison but not any other single politician somehow according to reddit every single democrat is an absolute angel socialist who only wants the best for america right they totally arnt on the same team as republicans they totally dont want people to be mindless zombies defending them no matter what they do yea those millionaire politicians whos salary is 268k a yearin before this gets locked i still doubt will ever face actual charges but here we areif ashley babbit s family weren t morons they d sue trump too he s a cult leader whose words got her killedarrest traitor trump nowi do want trump sued i want him in jail for the rest of his rotten lifei m so happy that orange cheeto will fleece his followers for more money to pay his lawyers it s the funniest shit to watch poor redhats squander away any extra funds they have to their lord savior donald trump it s pathetically hilarioussue his ass to the moon then maybe the doj can finally do something themselves fuck bulliesorange man still walking free america do your job and arrest this manon jan 6th trump held a campaign rally it was not an action by the us president it was an action by a candidate for office he wanted to be he incited his rally to attack the us capitol police and they did of course candidate trump is responsible for damagesso the police can sue people but no people can sue the police got itso what are we waiting for everyone keeps talking about how he violated this and run afoul of this broken this law groped this woman stolen this instigated a never has someone got such a laundry list of charges and not ever been actually made to answer for let alone serve any time how is someone so untouchable are the royal waiting to get everything titanium clad before knocking on his doorthey can but they wo just more no one is above the law bullshit nothing going to happen to himcan could should possible are news terms that mean it will not happenlmao i love how quickly it went from we throwing this pig in a cage to uhh maybe they could sue him like if they wanted to these people get away with anything and the public will allow itplease do it i m tired on all the actions the left promised to do less talking more actionwould police do this i feel like they as far right as trump is and would even consider itbut will he actually be indicted for his jan6 actions sometime this decadejustice dept maybe we can get the police to do our jobs for usthe doj is demonstrating immense political bias by refusing to charge and arrest trump we are supposed to believe they are a entity what a jokei can sue donald trump for emotional damages from the stress of his presidency anyone can sue anyone for anything breaking newsthe surviving ones that isjustice dept better find something quick that bars him from running soon since he honestly win with how public opinion on biden is souring by the minutewhile you all ramble on and on about republicans don t do shit democrats don t do shit it makes me wonder why so few of you come to a realization that they are one and the same the political class is in it for themselves period they are not here to serve the people all they have to do to keep their jobs is point the finger at the other party and accuse them of going after your children or destroying democracy they make promises they never intend to keep why didn t democrats ban assault rifles when they had a majority in the house and the senate but they re promising to do it now when it has zero chance of passng in the house answer because they can keep using the issue year after year to get you to vote for them as long as they keep us at each other s throats they put in a few year in congress make some insider trades skim some money off the top to put in their cayman account when they retire into obscurity they are obscenely rich and we re still here fighting the d s and the r s wake up peoplehow much longer do i have to wait to see thisabout time we got some good newsare we not gon na investigate the democrats for january 6thdeletedit will never happen every day that trump walks around a free man is another day closed to the collapse of the usalike watching one murderer kill another no one wins but hopefully someone losesi bet republicans would want to truly defund the police nowand i can work hard and become a billionaire we all can do things the question is will this be done the answer is noi looking forward to seeing all the cons get twisted up on who to support cops or orange mananyone can be sued for any reason it may get dismissed immediately thoughyea yea yea show me a convictiontotal shit show however you look at it i could sue each and every one of you does mean its going anywhereit s the only language he understandnannanare you glad its going into the private shareholders nowthis is probably akin to what happening with cigarette taxes here in the us states came to rely on a certain amount of revenue from cigarette taxes fewer people are smoking so they bump the tax up so more people quit so they bump up the tax wash rinse repeat and i sure the us postal service is having issues less mail because more internet online bill paying advertising money shifting away from mailers and towards online ad campaigns fewer holiday greeting cards replaced by via facebook or any number of online social platforms on the other hand the us postal service does handle some of the online retail shipping buzzing around the streets at all hours in some little trucks that were built in the 1980s highly inefficient but no money to upgrade and these employees do come cheap they get a salary plus benefits a decent pension the world is changingi ca remember the last time i bought a stampwell get busy with the concept of email nowwhat do people use stamps foryes say this assuming royal mail is one of those oddly titled uk things where they could have just said postal service now bring those prices for mail to the as everyone else that is under the age of say 60 99 of the mail i get is pure junk mail stuff i do not even read a waste of time and money and resources for literally everyone involved i get a card birthday or holiday or whatever every now and then but again from the very oldest people i know a text or email or call does the same thingnanalways figured he d be untouchable in argentina at leastas far as i know messi hasn t publicly criticized gangs or gang violence in argentina so i m not sure what their beef is here maybe they tried to shake him down for protection money and he refusedwho could ever want to kill messi never anything negative to say abt the guyhe must want to see what a person lynch mob looks likewhy do they go take a shit on maradona grave while they at so they can get a lynch mob after themmaybe not a good idea to go back to the old boys this probably not safer in miami eitherronaldo fans down bad after the world cupthey did a drive by on a grocery store his wife family owns and left a note threatening him and referencing the anti drug mayor seeing how he was in

packaging not to ever use tap water only distilled water for this exact reasonno joke when i worked in florida one of the teams at my job had a communal neti pot there were 3 or 4 people that would share one without cleaning it they put tap water from the break room in it still disgusts me 5 years later lolremovedtap water really shouldn t have killer amoebas in it even inimagine going your whole life looking both ways before crossing watching what you eat and always wearing your seatbelt only to get killed by an amoeba it s insultingcoke users in shamblesi heard a study that said the last few people who died from tap water in net pots drew their water from private well systems rather than a larger public water supplygot ta do a assessment of pressure washing your facial cavitiesdoes anyone know if this applies to houses with while house filtration systems and reverse osmosisthis is old news and incorrect the guy actually survived and became governor of the statetypically hear of at least one brain eating amoeba related death per year here in floridaca really blame them poor amoeba must be positively starved in floridai swear this story came out like 10 years ago a lady died from using a netti pota headline like this comes out every few summers or so it s rare but a fucking terrifying thought that something as mundane as a water park visit which is how one girl died from it a few years back can kill youlet put this in perspective you are way more likely to die hurtling down the freeway in a car than from brain eating amoebas even adjusting for the far fewer people that use a nasal rinsehey folks if you ever go to a tropical area and there is a water hike a common fun thing to do on almost all of these hikes is a spot where everyone jumps in the water from high up if you do choose to do that jump you are basically going to shoot shit water up into your sinuses and run the same risks as in this article just sayingthe amoeba infection is known as desantisphalusflorida is cool with dumping sewage in lagoons and oceanpoor amoeba fucking starvedlesson use a britta filter for your water in flordia we all know that flordia is run by insanity at this point so that not the lesson for todaywait that the actual standard of florida tap water caution may eat brain well explains desantiswell i d suggest it s just a fact of life in floriduh one doesn t need to do a sinus rinse to catch a brain eating disease down therethere was a woman from seattle who died this way imagine how much greater the risks are in hot and humid floridabrain eating redditors should be safethat amoeba is probably still hungry if it s eating a persons brain from floridaboil the fucking water you damn troglodytesit going to get worse as the planet heats uphow could they even tell his brain was being eateni been using a neti pot for about 20 years every day and i must admit i only use municipal tap water and saline packets out of convenience i like it a little warmer than luke warm and that is very difficult to achieve if you boil the water or use distilled water that is heated maybe some day this will get me but with all the other dangers in life that lurk at every turn i will take my chances not recommending that anyone else does it the way i do it but the chances of something like this happening are miniscule by the way i highly recommend anyone suffering from allergies try a neti pot this thing changed my life 20 years ago and it has been the single greatest think i ever done health wise amoeba or notserious question if you salt the water to at least seawater level would it kill the bacteria it is a freshwater bacteria after all edit i stand corrected amoeba not bacteriawow i do a nasal rinse and boil the water for it except i bought a filter version for travel now i m wondering if that s safe edited to add this is the product https and its materials say safer filters potentially harmful cysts such as naegleria fowler the brain eating amoeba which may be found in tap water convenient eliminates boiling tap water or purchasing bottled or distilled water certified meets stringent standards and cdc recommendation for nasal washing with tap water and neilmed is the most brand and their literature says please wash your hands fill the clean bottle with the designated volume of distilled b

amoebarepublican government killsthis is literally one of my worst nightmaresamazing such an organism can survive in florida much less find a viable hostwith it being a floridian i surprised the amoeba did starvetomorrow desantis signs a bill banning health officialsi thought they banned gender neutral language in floridaannndd this is why i can never trust doing a neti poti know florida officials will say don t use tap water but really why is brain eating amoeba in florida s tap water shouldn t all floridians be afraid i will avoid all jokes that the brain eating amoeba has already done its job on florida man because that would be insensitiveplease report this yt video https 28 seconds in you put luke warm water in the device fills from tap 116k viewsbrain eating amoebas in

bought says to use boiled and cooled waterthat shit says clearly multiple times use distilled water and i feel like i still see a headline like this at least once a yearremovedafter all his attacks on higher education i would assume we are naming this brain eating amoeba destanticusbut don t worry desantis totally isn t going to be too busy with culture war shit to deal with brain eating amoebas in the water supplyflorida rivals australia in the number of natural things that can kill youi would never trust any infrastructure in a red state to begin with boil your neti pot water and do forget to add salt and let it cool because some people are dumb and need instructions on shampoo bottlesalways filter your water people this is about fluoride either microplastics trace pharmaceuticals trace heavy metals they are proven to be real and plenty of areas around the world who have water treatment still actively struggle to guarantee clean safe water for citizens there is no harm only benefit to using a filter for you and your loved ones including pets pets especially their small body mass makes them even more vulnerable to long term damage i would advise not using a 20 brita they perform poorly in testing but you do need to spend a lot of money just avoid the cheapest ones around there plenty of data on youtube and around the internet on side by side performance benchmarks for water filtration worst case scenario is the filter is a safety tool just in case best case scenario it will objectively make you and your family healthier if you are what you eat what does that say about the water we drink 93 of bottled water tested contains microplastics and most brands are just tap water with marketing thrown on top 80 of freshwater on earth has microplastic contamination in it do take my word for it look into it for yourselfflorida this checks outi would never do that junki guess when i go to florida next month it bottled water for medamn my wife just had me try that navage thing last night i can breathe freely but now i can t remember my name or where i put my car keysdid the amoeba die of starvationyou would think by now after many news report about this people would think twice before doing this but unfortunately humans refuse to evolvenetti pot will kill youi usually boil it in my electric kettle then let it cool down i try to use it at around or lower mixed with a packet of nasal rinse salts and pop that into the rinse bottle the warm water is more pleasant seems to get more junk out and does live brain eating amoebasdear god rinsing with tap water wcgwthis is kinda close to me but this is the first time i ever heard of a sinus rinse or a neti pot so i think i be alrightthis was an episode of houseis this a risk for petsand i been thinking about getting one of those sinus washing machines because my sinuses are always messed upi just watched an episode of the good doctor where a child was afflicted by this very thingi boil water for coffee every morning in an electric kettle by that night is cold and sterile and i use that if i ever need to rinse there s always water left overwow interesting i sometimes shave my nose hairs and to get them out i suck water into my nose from the faucet and blow it out fast so i could basically be inviting something like this into my nose if my local water facility treatment center fails to kill it i may have to rethink how i get those small hairs outlimited menu options down there in flgood heavens florida republicans have successfully morphed into infections i recognize their mo anywhere they ve

been tested on animals many died honestly we were so rushed we forgot to keep track but it was like a so we re good for humans rightthe question is really what country will let him because i am 100 sure there are ones that will let himneuralink s regulatory struggles stem largely from its culture of setting goals for breakthroughs on extremely ambitious timelines and viewing regulators as obstacles to innovation according to more than a dozen current and former company employees what do you mean we ca do vivisection anymore musk made headlines late last year when he said he was already so confident in the devices safety that he would be willing to implant them in his own children which does actually mean anything if he does really care about his kids musk also has said neuralink would restore full mobility to paralyzed patients and it will be able to run thousands of tests using just a single drop of bloodthe statement by neuralink comes after the physicians committee for responsible medicine a us advocates alternatives to animal testing sent a letter to the us department of agriculture usda referencing violations and requesting an investigation into what it called apparent egregious violations of the animal welfare act related to the treatment of monkeys used in invasive brain experiments the document says the experiments were carried out pursuant to contractual agreements between uc davis and neuralink in the letter which spans more than 700 pages the physicians committee said records it obtained for the 23 monkeys used in the experiments reflect a pattern of extreme suffering and staff negligence the committee said that the letter to the usda is based on nearly 600 pages of what it calls disturbing documents released after the committee filed an initial public records lawsuit in 2021 httpsjust wait until your relatives learn that their favorite billionaire troll was the one who actually wanted to put chips in people brains not faucihe allegedly got a brain he can test it on himselfasshole will start testing on poor 3rd world country sitesif you let elon implant chips into people s brains we ll have a subscription service to pay for access to your own happy thoughts and memories inside of a yearfunny how people accuse bill gates of secretly planting mind control chips musk is trying to do it in the openi a bioengineer and elon talking about his brain implant was what made me really change my opinion of him before that i knew that he was prone to exaggerating and sometimes said some unhinged stuff but a lot of his talk about the brain implant was totally made up fantasy world stuff i mean the technologies are real and have a lot of potential but his detachment from reality is likely to set the whole field back if they let him try to do things that end up backfiring and hurting people edit this is the one i saw but he saying similar stuff in this clip https i mean the difference between listening to a few neurons and being able to read and download your memory and personality is like the difference between the wright brother airplane and a working warp drive for travelhe might try his luck some other placetry it out on some members of fox nation it could only helpadding elon musk ending humanity to my bingo cardithe agency s major safety concerns involved the device s lithium battery the potential for the implant s tiny wires to migrate to other areas of the brain and questions over whether and how the device can be removed without damaging brain tissue the employees said minor details picky government oversightthis motherfucker can t even figure out how to run an established social media website like i m gon na let him anywhere near my thinkin meatdid that chip already kill like thousands of monkeys in their lab tests yeah lets just get that shit on human brains i sure it have better results fuck you elon get on a rocket and fuck offyou could pay me enough to put a chip made by elon musk in my brain hard passthe guy who keeps on talking about the dangers of ai thinks this is a good ethical idea i ca grasp why anyone would think this is a good idea brain chips are such a stereotypical invention used in dystopian scifi stories to the point where everyone associates it with creepy imagerywho would trust elon musk of all people with a ducking brain chipelon playing too much cyberpunki m so tired of hearing about this dudedude ca even get self driving cars down pat and he ready to move on to brain chipsare his fan boys also complaining about chips in vaccinesas a neuroscience phd who been passively following this project for a thank godanyone who lets elon fucking musk put a brain implant in them probably needs it because they ve clearly already lost their mindcompanies are already shutting features behind pay walls for smart devices like recent incidents with bmw and volkswagen and ford recent patent filing for smart cars that drive away if you miss a payment we know how greedy and heartless companies are how they harm and take advantage of anyone to make or save fractions of a penny how they actively try to brainwash and gaslight us with propaganda how they use lobbying to sway policies that actively work against the interests of the citizenry and some of ya want them to implant shit in your brain it was never big government we had to worry about but big businesssafety concerns aside what does it actually do for the wearer will i have some sort of ai assistant voice in my head can i interact with networked devices have help doing complex math or will it be my boss zapping me whenever i daydream or wake me up while i on call with a claxon ringing in my brain advertising i ca turn off without paying a premiumright wing nutters the left is trying to brainwash us also the right wing nuttersfyi the company has first been testing its technology on animals killing some since 2018 and employee whistleblowers recently told reuters the experiments are going horribly wrong httpsno fucking shit the amount of time theyve been working on it tells me more than i need to know probably only submitted so he can claim he submitted something and its political or some stupid shit what a waste of life i used to work with lab monkeys i saw my role as being an advocate for better practices even if my company did like it there is no one else to speak for them studies like this would enrage me its killing monkeys for nothing you ca go from the tech we have now to this overnight there are many more steps in between killing monkeys for shitty useless data is abhorrenti worked in clinical research for a decade or so human experimentation is an extremely rigorous process and requires a decade of groundwork and will never get approval i literally seen human trials cancelled because the participants complained of headaches or because patients were sore at the injection site for a few days those were good solid products that offered significant benefit with extremely minor side effects musk is saying that over a thousand monkeys died in their testing https and his product barely works at all this product is even worth typing up the proposal but one of his employees still had to pitch almost 30 of our patients survive implantation and the product might actually do something someday but elon musk is a rich asshole i sure he find some irb somewhere that he can bribe into approving it and a whole lot of people are going to suffer because he an absolute sociopathjust go to china they will approve itwhen the us says no elon goes overseas he does really want oversight on these experiments anywaywho doesn t want fox news and twitter piped into their brains it will even autocorrect your replies honey what do you want to eat tonight fair and balanced zaxbysinteresting so maga who accuses bill gates of putting chips in the vaccine now worships a guy who is very publicly trying to put chips in people brains ca wait to hear them simp for him and say that people who do want chips in their brains are wokewhy not test it on yourself eloni have been watching that section of recentlyno to vaccines yes to brainchipsthis is 100 the start of his super villain arcbro ca even get his cars to self drive without any problemsi sorry but the last time i heard about these chips they were killing a bunch of animals and they want to move to testing on humans whatmeanwhile republicans are terrified that an mrna vaccine is microchippinganyone dumb enough to let that doofus put a chip in their skull is probably too dumb to see many effects from the inevitable malfunctionsnow stop letting him kill other animals en masse toosafety risks aside do you really want a chip in your brain controlled by a tyrant that abuses his power over consumers of his products when ever given the chanceelon is turning more and more into a literal bond villaindo worry guys you already got chipped with your vaccinehow about doing some cerebrospinal column therapies that actually work like don t stem cells https or molecular cocktails exotic one i ve just read about today https it s like these guys just want everyone to buy one or 4 different versions of their hardware then they can charge you a monthly for auto walk and promise that you ll never run into anything even with your eyes closed elons looking more and more like a corpo cyberpunk ripper doc than anything these daysanybody seen made for love on hbo hysterical it is basically this technology and they make the main character out to be like elon out of touch tech billionaire he tries to talk his wife into getting the chip installed but she s like fuck that he does it anyway and he can spy on her it s funny and scary at the same timeif you don t pay he turns off your brain good business modeldid he kill like a fuck ton of animals testing ithow twitter doing how about those self driving cars yeah i will passi can see it now elon musk recalls brains who in the right mind would allow a sleazy constantly failing corrupt as fuck megalomaniac put a computer chip in humans brains sheeshi mean with the way his tesla work the way he shown himself to believe on twitter do you really want that guy fucking around with your braini would trust a monkey with a hacksaw to put a chip in my brain more than i would trust elon frankly at least the monkey would more than likely fail to do ittell him to chip himself and his family first for ten years and we ll get back to him thenhe should do it to himself firstthe amount of primates he killed alone would be a non starter for the fda source i worked with research monkeys rats fish dogs mice sheep none of them are as heavily scrutinized as primate deathsthis mother fucker ca even figure out automatic windshield wipers no fucking shot i letting him do anything in my brainafter seeing elon s breathtakingly carelessness in skipping over basic design safety production quality and general ethics i marvel that he got clearance for testing on vertebrates i think he is a hitler in the making who salivates at the crazy idea of having a cyber back door to the systems of millions so he can blackmail or directly coerce them to do what he wants he is a bad person and i hope the twitter fiasco bankrupts and ruins him sooner than laterelon but wee have of people who want to volunteer regulators and this is why we exist to protect americans from scrupulous individuals like musk and protecting americans from bad products and services ps totally reminds me of the movie the belko https 20belko 20experiment 20is 20a josh 20brener 2c 20and 20michael 20rookerthis guy trying to impress elizabeth holmesthis same venture is currently under investigation https for animal cruelty would be surprised if he just set up shop in another countryin before media headlines like driver in tesla swerves across three lanes of traffic killing eleven people after spotting a squirreldeletedi don t think i would trust anything teleology wise in my body unless it was for medical especially since technology can easily become outdated or go out to service in 2020 a company that made bascily bionic eyes for blind people that gave them some blurry black and white the company went out of business and the people with them had to scramble to figure out what to do since they could not get legal repairs now and stuff i don t know all the details since i read a article about it in 2020 and that is what i remember but yeah i wouldn t trust something that could easily go out date or be discontinued like what musk is trying to make i bet he would cut access or discontinue them as soon as they aren t profitable or if musk s company gets shut yeahare these the same chips that killed all those monkeyshave they managed to at least not kill like one whole monkey yet last i knew they were really struggling with thatars technica article is free httpshe and zuckerberg can test on each otherdid 1500 animals die in testing this fuck this dumbassyou ca even handle twitter how you gon na handle a brain regulators probablyi see elon transition into a bond villain is continuing right on scheduleconsidering how tesla and twitter operate i do think he the guy to be going down this roadi know that project is far more than just musk himself but good god anything with his taint on it i would not trustmusk s company culture is incompatible with good science and thorough testing the fda requires bothno wonder he switched partiesthis article seems to trust elon like the promises he made are the exact same bullshit promises he made about self driving cars his vacuum sealed train his shitty robot etc if the promises were genuine and supported i sure there be a different responehe should implant a logic chip in his headthe exact same people who thought 5g was the cause of covid and that the vaccine was filled with tracking microchips put there by bill are now happy to accept the prospect of brain chips from elon muskthat s some black mirror shithe s totally gon na do it anyway right on some islandcoincidentally i just rewatched the black mirror episode playtest last night so that gon na be a no from meoff to china it is thenmaybe if they tested on deceased brains maybeteslas have caught fire before so of course there would be safety risks with this guy brain chips tooa recruiter sent me a job opening in engineering for this company i had a very serious ethical issue with not only the test process but ultimately that these chips will literally work in both directions the idea is if you have an implant you can control things outwardly but during their tests they were controlling pigs externally you will literally be under the control of whomever has access to these at his core he is a very sick man even worse musk uses the idea of helping out people who are paraplegic or quadriplegic as though this will cancel out all the evil and horror this will ultimately bring down upon mankindi m way to to ever get that done i don t know anything about technology on this scale but i know how good some hackers are idk if hacking these is even possible but if there s a minute chance i feel like some crazy dude will figure it out unfortunately this brain chip stuff will probably be the norm a few decades from nowwe killed a thousand monkeys and we re all out of ideasi mean does he have a secret lab in an extinct volcano to perform these teststhere is so much wrong with the american healthcare system but regulations exist for a reason audits and objective review are so important to keep the public safe these rules do exist to punish anyone it fine to be annoyed at regulators i know i have been i would trust this chip without the endorsement of every prominent regulation body in existencegood if his cars quality control is anything to compare it to 10 of peoples implants will breakthis dude is a snake oil salesman who buys other peoples ip he is the first to ride the hype train to the hundreds of billions impressive without a doubt but i think in 10 years we will see him as the prototypetest it on yourself if you so confident elonare these the same chips that they tested on chimps and had most of them dieelon musk is a villain frca even make self driving cars that do get in accidents and kill people and he wants to chip my brain no thanksso this whole time right wing nut jobs hate another billionaire because they think he wants to implant chips in us gates meanwhile elon their hero actually wants to do it and actually triedmoooom every monkey i had died can i have humans now sighciting common fucking sensewould trust musk to test a house electricity by sticking a fork in an electrical socket nevermind sticking a chip in my brainfreaks out about vaccines but wants brain chips sounds legitanyone else here think he does care and is already well along the path to testinghe killed 1500 animals lied about it and then went but it work on humans elon might actually be

thinks this is a good ideathis dude heading deeper down the lex luthor rabbit hole every daynot a shock considering how often he has shit in the open mouth of every regulation he ever come across no regulatory body in their right mind would trust this guy to obey any rules even rules he is legally obligated to obey and has sworn to upholdelmo is a fucking fascist ghoulthat logical if the survival rate is bad in animal studies which it was pretty bad then you ca go forwardwill people with brain chips scream at people they see without them like in the 1978 film invasion of the bodysnatchersthat a uhhhhh no brainerdude is a fucking mad scientist who named his kid like a radiohead album do they really think that s gon na stop him fuck elon and his family of rich slave tradersnanwhy do we refuse to take any financial punishment payouts from officers againnanis anyone gon na talk about the fact that after his arrest the city council thanked him for his like what i don t care if he built the city from the ground up why tf would you say that to somebody who just got indicted on 56 counts of cp possession13 mayors since 2021 for child sex crimes they trying to overtake teachers and priests as the lead occupation for kiddie diddlersit s maryland it s really not unusual for a mayor to be arrested before they complete their term there seriouslyyou just never know it could be anyone but seems to usually be a man is some sort of position of authorityugh not so much he had it but the fact he had that much makes me that means it child sexual assault is happening alot more than we think you cant possess that much unless it going on repeatedly most of the time these mother fuckers need to just be put on a remote island far away and left there need to not only go after him even the ones that got it through his distributioni find it fascinating that the political party wasn t mentioned so i assume he s a democrat a quick google showed me i was correct had he been a republican it would have been in the headline i vote democrat and find this shit so biased i don t care the political party in disgusting acts like this but damn it report things the same wayremovedremovedoh shit it pete buttgiegs buddy https edit why is this getting down votednot a good look for him and his platformi was doing research just like pete townsend yeah that s the ticketthe part of this i find most shocking is that college park has a mayornanflew for 15 minutes reaching an altitude of msl this is quite amazing and could be relatively easy expanded in terms of flight time the only question i have is how many kilograms of hydrogen did they use for the 15 mins of flight timefor anyone who did read article this was an electric motor being tested on one side of the aircraft with the other being a conventional turbine engine aka turboprop the electric motor was fed by electricity generated in a fuel cell that used hydrogen as the fuel source in other words they did burn the hydrogen in a turbine engine this is why the pilot reported it was so much smoother it was an electric motor the hydrogen was sourced from water not from natural gas so was in some sense truly greena short proof of concept flight with one engine and one ice for flight safety and comparison the engine was less noisy and produced less vibrations they developed a retrofit kit to use with existing planes and that ship on existing infrastructure sounds like the tech was developed in france but it being by many companies arpubd the world i wonder what pressure we can use to for our local airlines to get on the listgot ta love the name lightning mcclean this is great newsmost everyone is missing the point of uh2 they are creating a for an application of their primary mission which is hydrogen logistics even if every plane had one of these cells for each engine there no infrastructure to supply it x200b now that they proved this out it gon na be a pivot towards how to supply the h2 in a manner to support the gigantic number of retrofits that are going to make but no is going to make that retrofit until there a reliable supply that supports their ops so the comments worrying about the efficiency comparison are missing the forest for the treesi feel toyota had the right idea but wrong application hydrogen is the future for the airlines and commercial vehicles but not for personal vehiclesum was the hindenberg a hydrogen powered air shipfirst thing i yea i use but stillso are we just speed running the greatest hits of the 1900s the rise of fascism looming threat of another world war economic collapse just on horizon the fucking hindenburg oh the humanitynanthey lucky they were so close to shore unlike tom and eileen lonergan https about whom the movie open water is loosely basedit happens more often than you would think i went on a tour where the headcount was what i thought at the time over the top when we got back to shore it turned out they lost two people the summer beforeit was just too disorganized everybody kept moving so they easily got missed they are in open water everyone is supposed to keep moving pretty much to avoid getting kicked in the face by another snorkeling tourist what should not have been missed is a headcount on the boat or an easy eyeballing of the waters to see if someone is still in the water facepalmi ve been on close to 100 dive boats there should have been a headcount and a written checklist before the boat moves they re very lucky that they were only from shorethe complaint noted that sail maui has changed its head count protocols since the incident but the company declined comment because the lawsuit is pending not changed so much as startedholy crap that absolutely terrifying imagine you swimming towards the boat

the best snorkeling the article makes it seem like they were just abandoned way out there getting left by the boat is fucked up and they definitely deserve some compensation for that but it not like they were floating out in the middle of the ocean with fins it less than a 5 minute swim great way to ruin a honeymoon though damneveryone is assigned a number they call out the number getting on the boat and getting off easyyou got snorkel and fins swim back to shore and do your 3 mile rucki wonder what the company s terms are like i know cruise ships will leave you if you re not back in time ok maybe cruise ships were a bad example from experience doing stuff like this usually comes with a contract beforehand signing away liability sky diving snorkeling trampoline parks etcobviously there should be headcounts but i ran various tours and the amount of times people just wonder off on their own thinking they can run their own tour is baffling it hard enough to heard cats through various

finance figured it was materially off should have accounting they are happy if it does balancenanany police officer incompetent enough to not know the difference between a gun and a taser is far too incompetent to be trusted with eitherhe called 911 for help while suffering from a mental health crisis but was shot while handcuffed on the ground if the dudes handcuffed why do you even need taze him he called for mental health support and winded up a paraplegicas a nurse i could be charged with a crime for carelessly mistaking one drug for another not to mention losing my license and entire career i just want the folks enforcing laws with ability to use deadly force to be at least as regulated as a nurse nurses are constantly in danger one of the most dangerous professions and situations edit as argued below it is rare for a nurse to be criminally charged for an error but the loss of license and livelihood is an ever present danger edit 2 since the debate on who gets disciplined more is still raging the best source i found so far states according to the ncsbn each year less than 1 of nurses have any adverse action taken against their licenses according to the npdb there were adverse actions against nursing licenses in 2021 only police officers have ever been decertified by a state as of around 2017 that is a huge disparity in disciplines even accounting that by very rough

sure feel safe and secure knowing the people authorized to fucking murder us if deemed necessary supposedly can t distinguish left and rightthat officer should be in fucking prisona misdemeanor for shooting a man abd paralyzing him america is wildthe taser was supposed to replace guns but ironically it has made police much more dangerous when taser initially camr out in the 90s it was marketed as putting guns out of business because police would only draw it if they felt threatened or in an emergency instead police will pull a taser out if the wind blows the wrong way and now theyre mistaking tasers for guns killing more innocent peopleanyone who ever held a firearm and a taser knows it roughly the difference between holding a plunger and a steak knife your hand knows the difference even if you are too stupid to get it this dude was shot on purposei doubt they mistook it they look and feel different he shot him and came up with a bad excusepolice just should even have an ability to draw a gun except in the most extreme of circumstances they police like they are military and we are the enemyif you having a mental health crisis call family call a help line call anyone but the cops your mental health crisis will quickly become either a physical health crisis or a i about to go to prison crisis they are not there to protect you their job is to arrest people so they can be chargedas this guy learned never call the cops unless you want someone to dieofficer kim potter of the brooklyn park mn pd is currently serving 2 years for the negligent homicide of daunte wright who she accidentally killed in a traffic stop on april 11 2021 exactly the same she thought she was tasing him and had her pistol instead of course the difference is that daunte diedwhen i was deployed to a combat zone our rules of engagement said that we could only fire at combatants that had weapons and were directly aiming at and threatening shooting us police officers just shoot anyone including hand cuffed individuals without weapons the police have less rules of engagement than i did when i was in herat province afghanistanhe is naked and handcuffed with multiple officers on the scene that is a dangerous man there is no need for a taser much less a firearmhow the fuck do you mistake your service weapon for a taser hmm why does my taser feel a lot heavier why is my taser not painted bright yellow like it usually is but like my glock why does my taser have glock iron sights idk but i guess it still is a taser so i gon na go ahead and shoot it lolmoral of the t call cops for help call the fire department or emsmodern day droogs a clockwork orange spelled out present day policing juvenile delinquents given authority and qualified immunityooof in florida they ll probably give the cop a purple heart because he stubbed his pinky on his belt choosing the wrong guni m conflicted here because florida man is the more rations party in this headline which is not per accepted conventionthe pig was only charged with a misdemeanor the courts really protect their costumed porcine criminals i hope this guy wins millions he never receive justice in a 2 tiered court and those porcine criminals will have their goal in life to eventually ruin more lives there no scum like porcine scumand the tax payers will pay why the fuck we ever decided cops should have to pay for their own mistakes i never understandone of the few florida mans i ll stand behindshades of oscar grant i m really glad this dude liveddon t tasers also have a laser i ve always seen them being pointed and then you can see the laser this guy needs to be held accountable unless he fired it from his hip i don t see how he made the mistake minus the fact the taser and pistol are on opposites of his bodyi cant imagine the reaction of everyone when the officer yells taser taser taser and then a live round pops offidiocracy was a funny movie but living in it is annoying afhe called 911 for help while suffering from a mental health crisis but was shot while handcuffed on the america fuck yeano amount of training can make you a decent human being if you aren t one alreadyonly time i ever reached out for help during a horrible panic attack i ended up sobbing in the back of a police cruiser begging them to take me to a hospital and not the station never againi can safely say that if this happened to me i would put every penny i have into paying the right people to make that police officer have a slow and painful deathyeah idk wtf these officers be doin but one has bullets the other does not and weigh completely different if u can t tell them maybe u shouldn t be a copall this mistaking guns for tasers bullshit can easily be solved by making it mandatory that all tasers be holster in the middle of the chestwrong state for filing a case against the copsthis happened in minnesota too guy died officer potterhonestly tasers should have completely different firing mechanisms so when this happens we can be 100 sure it was intendedplot twist cop is the florida manhopefully he gets a huge settlement out of thisflorida man finally gets his dueman my head messed up from reading to much of this shit lately i read that title completely wrong i imagined some scenario where the cop comes up on a dude with a gun the cop thinks it a taser and then shoots him the guy is down on the ground screaming it was just a gun it was just a gun i ca feel my legs and the cop is like damnit not againthis is the reason why tasers should not look or feel like guns too many officers mistaking their handguns for tasers does seem to matter that the tasers are yellow or kept on the side in the heat of moment the officer is not paying attention nor looking to see if it is indeed a taser yes it may take longer to train officers to use a taser that is not but if it prevents someone from being shot it is worth itseems fair btw this happens a lot httpsthe taser should be opposite side of where your firearm is holstered are we sure this dude mistook it reallysuing the police must be a white people thingnanwoman was arrested and booked on a bond of over 18 million for over 800 criminal counts after she allegedly used her aunt debit card to spend thousands of dollars on food and groceries title makes it sound like she ripped off a lot of elderly it was her aunthere i was thinking there was some major bust taking place on some kind of huge extortion scheme against the elderly 18 million bond over 12k why evenon the surface this does seem too insane but i wanted to post it here because she is literally being held on an 18million bond for ordering 12k worth of doordash with her elderly aunt credit card over the course of several months just an all around shitty situation for everyone involved is what she did wrong 100 absolutely and she deserves to be punished and pay restitution to her aunt having said that 18 million for ordering 12k worth of doordash just seems fucking insaneshe forgot that you have to become president first12k in food in 3 months what she eating filet mignon and caviar every dayshe posted bail with 18 million in werther originalsshe spent on food over several months and is charged like this remember this when reading about the politician who only got 1 million illegallythe pedophiles are going to get out sooner than hermorris was arrested for 136 counts each of identity theft bank fraud computer fraud felony theft access device fraud and exploitation of the infirmed for a total of 816 criminal counts i believe that called throwing the book at them could happen to a nicer ladyjesus what the hell was she buying through doordashthis article https that i read earlier has a tiny bit of additional infothey are making an example of her as a message for those who are not as privileged as they are if you are poor no good representation and youre gon na get punished to the maximum so you get the message if you rich you get a lawyer you can afford and get off scot free or a slap on the wrist with community service and a small restitution that america in a nutshell not that she does deserve to be in prison but 18 million on bond is abusive use of judicial processhow about we also hold upper class financial villains the same way start with the people behind wells fargo bank of america and equifax they have done more damage than this one woman ever will all she did was order copious amounts of takeout food the 18 million bond is practically saying there two justice systems out louddollars in 3 months sounds like she was just trying to bankrupt her elderly infirm aunt leaving her with no way to pay for end of life this horrible person and i hope she rots in prison for being such a piece of shitthis is why criminals need to incorporate in deleware she would have gotten away with a slap on the wrist like any other bank or fox news advertisersooo i guess those bankers who caused the gfc are really gon na do some time too then yes hello12k spend on food delivery in just two months what was she ordering and much does she weigh now after that food frenzyshe ate 12000 dollars of door dash in one year omgthat bond is waaaay too high i mean i do really agree with the bail system regardless but even if i did i would call that excessive she used her aunt credit card for a bunch of doordash it was a terrible thing to do and she needs to be held accountable and whatnot but 18 millionshe is a shitty person no doubt but 18 million for the alleged theft of is insane when we have people who conspired attacked police and broke into the capital and found guilty walking away with home detentionnobody is allowed to rob the elderly except congresswow you should see the crimes that people in here in houston bond out for nothing much worseelder and vulnerable adult abuse is really bad but this bond clear seems excessive you are still innocent until proven guilty but with a bond like this the next day she will see out side of jail is in the court roomi ve love to have someone explain to me why this type of fraud is worse and punished but when banks do it it s just and oops and a small finei was quick to judge this is bad but not as bad as the click baitdamn ca even get corporations for a fraction of that for doing much worse to millions of people system is working perfectlylooks like a female kyle rittenhousewhat other insane decisions has that judge made in the past edit i wonder if it some standard amount per charge and since it over 800 charges it just multiplies out to a ridiculous number looks like something like per criminal chargean 18 million dollar bond for 12k in fraud but the crypto scammers are walking freewhite collar elder abuse is apparently taken more seriously than good old fashioned physical elder abuse huh weird18 million bond for doordash trump is walking freeshe was probably high or drunk and depressed and didn t even realize how much everything added up to horrible behavior using someone else s money when my parents died unexpectedly and left me half a million i probably spent on skipthedishes delivery because of depression and convenience had i realized the amount i was spending i would have been horrified it s so easy to just order food on your phone and never look at your bank account in my case it was because i had a giant amount of cash but in this situation it s because she s a outcome thoughstill got nothing on rick scottpossible defense she is really dumb and bought doordash once for auntie the card was saved by google then buying door dash everyday and not noticing her account was not being because she only checks the balance not the transactions on her account until her aunt noticed and the bank found her and pressed charges800 crimes i glad this animal is off the streetany idea what state i guessing floridananfrom the article the group not bombs has been operating since 1995 but because of a city ordinance they have been asked to move their operations to a different location about a mile away on wednesday volunteers still gathered in front of the downtown houston library and served food to about 100 people before an officer with the houston police department ordered them to stop and move to another location those who were helping to serve the meals decided to stay put and one of them received a ticket from the officerthe rodeo is in town they are moving the homeless for appearance reasonsand jesus said give citations unto them for my children will not learn to picketh themselves up by thir bootstrapswhat exactly is the offense and how much is the fineif only they had a few teenagers with uvalde taught us that texas cops won t go near you thenit kills me that the powers that be corporations and authorities will do anything to make money and have no solution in fact punish for those who don t america fucking suckswhere in the bible was jesus cited and fine for feeding the poorthe real question is why politicians who had abilities to remove the law are hiding behind the scene instead of being roastedfood not bombs rules and are ogs at this type of mutual aid they deserve your support if there is a group in your areaatlanta pd made us move a few times over the years we never were ticketed but we also moved when asked to do sovolunteers feeding homeless in downtown houston ticketed by hpd officer ticketed by hpd officer hpd officer oficial hdp hijo de put that accurate titletexas and florida are determined to win the title of most shameful state in the union grim humans enable this sort of behaviourthese laws were first enforced in sodom and gomorrahi not sure how houston does it but many other locations have adopted these laws as well and not simply just red states california adopted these laws not to long ago when you word a title so vaguely just sounds horrible like the law is out to force homeless to just starve to death if you took ca as an example especially during covid homelessness went rampant not only did it go rampant but homeless individuals generally congregated around specific areas such as areas with a lot of people and food notable areas in la would be around food banks such as the la mission or large touristy areas such as sunset blvd hollywood this brings many issues to the community businesses lose business because the increase of homelessness deters individuals from visiting said business es if a hundred homeless people were outside violence and crime increases amongst the homeless community a lot of drugs are brought into the area further exacerbating the violence and crime issues a massive mess is made which becomes exponentially more costly to the city to consistently clean which is taxpayer money either more cops need to be hired for said crimes meaning more taxpayer money spent or la must deviate it current force to focus on the hotspots and pulls their forces away from other areas they deemed safer that may experience a sudden unexpected crime but suddenly no officer is nearby more theft occurs a lot more theft but ignoring those facts i too am guilty of wanting to help and feed those in need there more reasons than above on why la made feeding the homeless illegal to an extent there already designated organizations la has delegated the job of feeding homelessness these organizations are in specific areas to pull the homeless population towards them and not around areas like sunset blvd these organizations also have resources to further help the homelessness such as finding them shelter clothes treatment etc they protecting those that try to feed homelessness outside the organization but what protection do you need when you feed them not all people are good people including those in need there are some bad homeless people who can and will attack those good samaritans to steal their belongings if your food was cooked well and caused food poisoning or some other issue arose from your food you fed to the homeless you liable and at risk of being sued not only can this happen but it has happened there have been good samaritans sued by homeless for millions can you imagine helping someone and they sued you for your life income and they won by having officers actively punish those feeding the homeless as well la can deter individuals handing out food in areas they trying to pull homeless out la mission can only do so much but if you go to sunset blvd cause there are some homeless there and start feeding them yourself you giving the population there a reason to not move towards the la mission you further exacerbate the issue on sunset blvd and now la mission needs to start from scratch essentially i volunteered at so many food banks and i see police officers there all the time on their ofttimes helping out as well these are usually the same officers handing out tickets to unauthorized individuals handing out food it not that the officers or the city does care they trying hard homelessness is an issue not targeting the individuals that are homeless though there are right ways to handle these issues if this food not bombs group wants to help feed the homeless they should help the city with a strategy not just set up base wherever they want they think they helping but for all we know the street they chose to set up base may now be targeted with crimes over the next few weeks they harmed far more than they helpedthere can be very good reasons for this though a church in my area was feeding homeless in a park downtown because of this more and more homeless started sleeping near the park to the point where it became unusable drug needles piles of garbage and human waste the church was forced to stop and the park had to be shut down for quite awhile to be cleaned up it was unsafe unsanitary and it nearly killed some of the restaurants nearby that were already struggling because of covid the city has homeless shelters and food kitchens but you ca have in shelters so some homeless refuse to stay therecops work for capital homeless people don t buy stuff god forbid anyone help themi am not against what they are doing at all and fuck the police that are giving them trouble but also why not just set up a mile away where they are being asked tothat not a news article that a paragraphthis is the kind of thing that convinces me that all cops are sociopaths because if you told me that for work i had to go out and fine people volunteering their time to feed the homeless i would quit right then and thereimagine the mindset of the officers that actually go out of their way to implement these laws against society the choice is theirs instead of honoring their oath to protect serve society by looking out for real dangerous crimes they choose to waste their time making sure the homeless hungry starve to death someone explain to me how this reconciles with christian values because i don t see iti take that to court and drag the press in there with me that hpd officer is inhuman garbage bet she identifies as some religious nutbagwhat a diseased societystark reminder that police in america are sworn to protect private property and not serve the citizensso in a state with christian values you can be ticketed for feeding the hungry got itgo be homeless for awhile and see how quickly your hate for the world escalates real solutions need to kick in before someone is forced out into the street the amount of hate towards the unhoused is amazing there are definitely some terrible people out there but the majority are people just trying to survive as a result of a medical bill a rent hike job loss while living paycheck to paycheck 40 have a job while being homeless people get myopic about drugs and crime because it scares them but you ll never cure this i ll without addressing the real causescan t say it enough fuck the policethis has so much missing contextah yes smell that sweet texas freedomremind me again how the police serve the public interest by using taxpayers resources ticketing people feeding hungery unhoused people fascist fucksamericans fucking hate homeless peoplesupply side jesus handing out those ticketsthis article actually has some details https the rules and regulations for the approved public site are each approved charitable food service location on city of houston property must have the following 1 adequate parking for the personnel conducting the food service event the minimum number of parking spaces shall be ten 10 dedicated spaces during charitable food service events 2 adequate trash containment to contain all trash refuse and litter on the site of the food service event 3 two 2 portable restrooms with hand washing stations available during food service events and available 24 hours per day seven 7 days per week 4 adequate personnel to conduct the food service event and restore the site at the conclusion of the food service event 5 adequate trash receptacles trash containment and removal measures to contain all trash refuse and litter on the site of the food service event and to properly dispose of all trash refuse litter and remove unused foods from the site at the conclusion of the food service event 6 adhere to guidelines for food preparation transport serving handling storage and packaging in accordance with the fda model food food ordinance the officer advised organizers that police would help transport their food to the designated public location but organizers declined instead they went ahead and served hundreds of meals to those in line anywaycops the biggest gang by farthis is what passes for in america today if we were bombed by an enemy and the streets were littered with bricks and debris our law enforcement would probably hand out tickets for unkept sidewalks instead of helping their fellowman dead people would be handcuffed and arrested for vagrancy people bleeding on the sidewalks would be arrested for public nuisance this is what passes for today in america it s an embarrassment so why do they lack shameso low we re killing the homelessred state doing red state things republican jesus would be proudoh texas how low can you gopolice doing things they can but really shouldn tthe police are not your friends their job is to protect the property of people with much more money than we got do not approach they are generally armed and dangerousjust protecting the community and doing my job like a good naziit has to be something with red states how dare you feed the homeless that we want to pretend do not exist in florida i live in the area hit really hard by ian a business restaurant reopened using shipping containers people celebrated now a few months later they made that same place close down because it was not he never intended to keep they there forever just until he could rebuild these states worry about the stupid things that help fellow humans government stepping in where they did not need to beticketing volunteers will be my answer the next time i get a call from the fallen officers fund other group just go ticket some if you need moneywithout government who would stop you from volunteering to feed hungry peoplethe war on the impoverished in this country is some bullshit i was behind two elderly gentlemen in line at the grocers yesterday and they were told that they couldn t take the buy their rotisserie chicken with food stamps the reason because it s still hot so i asked does that mean any of the sandwiches and other fresh prepared food they sell in their deli and the answer was yes why is it cool to punish people because they have no moneyi m pretty sure that cop had a wee chubbywe criminalize poverty in this country and it s completely fucked upwhat does this say about our society the police are ticketing volunteers while road rage idiots drive through town feeding homeless is bad but road rage is fine and acceptable the police chief should be embarrassedleave it to the cops to fuck up a good thingand jesus said unto his followers do feed the poor if they poor they deserve to starveremovedsomeone asked earlier what the opposite of a hate crime is this is itwhy are people surprised by this the us is a professional used car salesmen one side cries but doesn t vote the other side hates and voteswtf is wrong with peoplethis is christian conservatism bigoted big government criminalizing real americans actionsi d challenge that in court quicker than you could say 1st amendment violationhow very of you texasreally sad and messed up to see thisi rip that shit up in his facetruly the land of the freeyeah some real good police work going on here got ta make sure the businesses that woulda got paid off these homeless people scrounging up enough for a cookie have their bottom line protectedit always texas man alwaystexans proving once again that they assholes and are angelsdeletedthat what happens when you park illegallythis is a slippery slope of course you want to be able to help the homeless but what happens when that 1 person who hates homeless people decides to poison the food they give them i ve learned to never underestimate the lows people can go and on the flip side don t think for a second that a person down on their luck that maybe gets sick from donated food wouldn t try and sue i think that s more for if a restaurant were to give leftover food it sucks but just like disclaimers they re because someone ruined it for everyone elsenani hate canadian nazisi just picturing the guys setting the photo up hey like what if we tip over one of the ammo boxes and dump out a small pile of bullets that look cool rightall these nazis stockpiling weapons is a bit unnervingin america we call that a cachewhy were the rcmp at maxime bernier house37 weapons are they counting stripped lowers as weapons that doesnt countamerican here this is an underwhelming weapons cache at best this dude would decimate the local deer populationcanada does pamper armed nazis like the us doesobligatory fuck nazis canada so fucking weak these days tho i see some bolt actions maybe a pellet gun or two and some 80 lowers that would require 1000 in parts to actually become a gunthese people are why i own firearms and train constantly i hate guns and i look forward to the day i can hand in my guns until then i advise the nazis to not try mei m curious if the brothers had modified diesel trucks with flags hanging off of italways need to double check whether we talking about mounties or the red hot chili peppersthat s mostly just hunting rifles how overdramaticwow such guns much wowwith our justice system they will probably get a few weekends in prison in 3 or 4 years worst case scenarioif you ca arm a battalion calling it major is a misnomeroh no they also had an air pistol too glad that off the streetsat least you canadians can do something about your guys nazis it would be so dope if america could something about over 70 of our police officers would be out of an easy abusable jobnow trudeau can ban bolt action rifles since the nazis use them its western nazis that must be stopped from owning 1930s bolt action military assault weapons putin will love this storycongratulations we managed to make a meaningful impact to gun crime in canada amusingly not a single one of these appears to be one of the rifles that the liberals is trying to ban it almost like the whole point was to be as ineffectual and highly visible as possible actions like these are how gun violence gets solved political theater bills do nothing to helpron desantis lives in canada tfcan we just start this race war and get the fucking neos to mask offgeoff gariepy i bet atleastnanit just leads to

its a 30 foot empty crawl spacethat the sphynx vaginaare they going to find eddie in there tell me why i had to be a powerslavenanfrom what i was reading the greek railroad system is underfunded poorly maintained and horribly out of date the electronic warning systems have been out of action for years everything electric has failed and is done manually instead even traffic signal lights were inoperative the train drivers are basically blind to any changes or dangers on the line this was an accident waiting to happen it seemswtmf is going on with all of these train crashes worldwidepeople marching in the streets in massive numbers this is how angry americans should have been after the east palestine crash hope every hack train operator receives their justiceyou can draw a straight line from austerity measures to this crashi assuming this is because the country is brokedeletednanthere was a man next to him with kids in a tweet the man says the victim died in his arms this dude was just in library with his kids and do you even call this get me a puppy to wash my eyes stati live and work in the city it feels like things are getting worse here i work security at a hotel and had to go hands on withan aggressive homeless person this morning never used to be the case until about 6 months ago i m not sure how things gets better and what can be done most threads and convo about the homeless problem devolve into shouting matcheswhy are people so much more awful since the pandemic even traffic is worsecitizens in the library intervened disarmed the stabber and took him into custody until police arrived mpd added i m not even shocked or surprised that libraries have been overrun by the homeless and they re killing each other i just want to point out the fact that unarmed citizens at the library were able to disarm a person with a knife and keep him alive but a fully geared armed and supposedly trained cop gets terrified at the slightest twitch and will unload their entire gun into peopledam wtf thats a nice area in dc tooyeah but according to shaun king this does matterhe was just stabbed he was stabbed and killedhttps https last time sleepy joe got involved he stopped the rail workers from going on strike over safety and work hours issues that did turn out wellnan38 years knowing you did do it damn idk if i stay sane that longnice released 23 years after he requested the dna test that would two decades later exonerate him the american legal system is a jokecan anyone explain why when dna exists why both the prosecution and defense would not have an issue testing it it helps with things that are cut and dry like thismillions of dollars he should get millions of dollars in compensationanother example of why i am 100 against capital punishmentand this kids is why you should be against the deaths penalty innocent people do get jailedi just watched the movie outside in with edie falco about this topic it was a light indie flick and didn t do more than scratch the surface but even that was heavy and sad i am happy for this man and sad that our pathetic justice system stole his life from himalito we only found out about his innocence because we did execute him fast enoughso i d say pay that man a million per year he was locked uphow is it possible that so many people are found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt when it was actually a different person entirelywhat a nightmare how do you make it up to a person who was wrongfully taken from their life and home and loved ones no amount of money can make that rightsuing the state is a given but people need to start suing the prosecutors as well so many of them know the evidence is sufficient and many times all times any evidence uncovered that does fit their narrative is completely ignored definitely not shared with the defense winning is all that matters to these cunts if they were sued in situations like this they might think twice about their actions probably not but they mightanother example of corruption article says that there was an attempt to give him the death sentence too but ended up with life in prison insteadfor those who aren t aware approximately of prisoners are wrongfully convicted https this often happens because public defenders are oversubscribed having sometimes hundreds of cases httpsi can t even imagine my anger at the world if this happened to methe fuck they had a swab of the killers spunk but never bothered to test it against his s makes me fucking so angry when shit like this happens like wtf were they doinglife sentence for the judge the prosecutor and the police that put this man behind bars for nearly forty yearsbest possible argument against the death penaltyit time to start locking up the judges who wrongly imprison people should be equally sentencingthe fact that this happens regularly is enough to completely rule out the death penaltydna testing should be a standard component to all investigations at this point retroactively as wellfuck this legal systemnow pay the man more than he could ask for you can not replace your time on earth with more man should get boat loads of cash it s the best they can doit a virtual certainty that the cops and prosecutor knew it was not him probably the judge as wellit terrifying how often this happensi use to be a supporter of the death penalty but over the years reading about cases like this has caused me to change my mind i hope he gets some form of compensation for this especially since he requested dna testing years ago and they refused his requestthe other reason you shouldn t have the death penaltyand cases like this one is one of the reasons why i have changed my mind on capital punishment it saddens me to think just how many innocents we have sent to the chair over the yearsi do think i be able to avoid going crazy being held for one year for something i did do let alonehe should get 10 millionah these cases break my heart so sorry hastings that you were deprived of 38 years of living your life in the manner you could never apologize enough todo the cops prosecutors and judges ever feel shame when something like this surfacesthe fact that these people are nearly always black says somethingimagine all the people still there or all the people in there for weedthey better be giving him millions of dollars crucial years he wo ever get back has no price tag though they literally robbed his life a few million is the least they can do for him to finally live in comfort for the rest of his lifei hope this man gets his moneyonly 21 years between the time his lawyer demanded a dna test and when they did it which is better than in some cases they actually released him within two years of the dna proving him innocent which is damn fast since in many cases you have to wait five or more yearsaccording the rittenhouse stooges the court system never gets it wrong this is the 2nd post like this today with different people both imprisoned for something they did doguessing if he were white he would been out soonerit always a black guy getting wrongfully imprisoned crazy because america definitely is racist reddit said sofor those who have clicked the link yet i taking bets on skin colorthis would be a pretty honourable charity set up pretty much a dna testing factory which entirely exists to validate various convictions this same factory could also be testing rape dna samples which apparently there are entire warehouses of untested samples ironically the oldest samples would be the ones with the most egregious justice problems wrongfully convicted living with decades of punishment and the guilty wandering around super easy to catchwhat s that subreddit for feel good stories that are actually fucked up and sadthe wonders of dna and technologythis is so enraging the so called justice system we have wants to never be proven wrong if they had granted his appeal to have the dna checked and ran through codis they would have found that a man who had raped and killed another woman had done it the state stole time from this man and nothing can give those years back to himthe only thing keeping him sane was a chunk of millions waiting for him once he suesnanone of the best you can still see some of his later stuff with the jlcowashington post wayne shorter jazz musician of innovation and introspection dies at 89

if it s he was in the general location and was known to acquaintances and the only reason we could think of a reason a sweet potato was on the scene was silencer well then the defence is going drive a

people already face enough real hate and violence people do need this pos playing pretend for internet the hell he was trying to dojussie is a dope who committed a really stupid illegal act with malicious intent i do believe it went much further and became larger than he ever intended or believed it would go don t forget that the corrupt local prosecutor tried to drop the charges and make this just go away it was only because a judge appointed a special prosecutor that smollett s bs was exposed in a court of law the news networks politicians and hustlers who echoed chambered his bs after the first week when his story really began to fall apart are guilty in promulgating this racial hoax the damage they did to real victims of hate and racism will take generations to heal just a sad event all aroundthe same people who still defend him are the same that defendjuicy smooyay the french actorat the very least all of this reinforces just how much jussie smollett has in common with trump they are both absolutely different sides of the same coin imo consider trump only hinted at running for office initially in hopes of leveraging nbc for better contract renewal terms for his broadcast series if we re to believe his alleged https private conversation s w howard stern likewise jussie felt empire series producers weren t giving him enough so he manufactured his own hate mail in hopes of supplementing his stasis within the production when that didn t work he his intent to run in wrote and produced his very own pr campaign crime scenario in hope of eliciting grassroots social media campaign thereby forcing fox producers reconsider his pr value for them they both swim in the same cesspool of buffoonery imhoman the ego on this guy wish his family would straight up tell him he a failure rather than stand behind his continued embarrassment campaigni guess he thinks bad publicity is good publicity i do even know what he was on but i only know him for his legal troubles if he would have just continued to act he would of been ok but he acted a fool and paying the price play stupid games win stupid prizesnanjapan working it youth into the ground and they do carei believe historically people expected their children to add to their family wealth i wonder if that the biological expectation and society is unknowingly just waiting for children to become valuable enough again people talk about how governments will struggle with services but a person in good health will become a valuable commodity i wonder if that how we find the balancing pointit almost as if people ca afford to have kidsthey relied on old men to solve this problem and surprise it s worse then ever because the solution requires deep cultural and economic changes but it is also a canary in the coal mine because this is now becoming a world wide issue with people of child bearing age are told they can t afford homes they have insane debt and stagnant wages why bother now we are seeing areas of the world where they are limiting a womens access to reproductive medicine i wonder whypeople are dying of overwork and people ca have kids i so stumped right nowwhen large animal populations begin to fall we call it stabilization when it humans it called a crisis the only difference is our adherence to a growth economywe learned about this in grade school in the 80it not a crisis it a good thing endless growth is impossible we need sustainability and a new economic framework that abandons the fiction that endless growth is necessaryjapan is just further along the same

who only make more money if there are more people to sell stuff to nothing at all wrong with the world losing populationmy concern is what happens to the economy my concern is what happens to young people particularly women when governments realize that a lot of people quite simply are not having kids because they do want kids iran already started restricting access to birth control and vasectomies and did hide the fact that it was because of a plunging birth rate what are we going to see nextdepopulation is not a crisisthe world is overpopulated this is good newssorry i was told growing up overpopulation was ai volunteer as a tributeit funny to me how when these articles pop up every other month it seems we project all of our own existential dread onto them you see it all in these comments when in reality it a solution that has 100 to do with politics and xenophobia if governments had the fortitude to relax immigration policies and incentivize larger families all this would go away but they ca because change represents uncertainty and that uncertainty can be used as a wedge by their opponents so we on this trajectory where it has to get to such a failed state that action is undeniable then you at the mercy of who is in power at the time and it potentially being even more drastic of changes instead of the easier ones you could make nowthe issue is not failure to have children there are plenty of humans all over the world the issue is governments unwillingness to supplement the lowered birth rate with immigrationjust approve others people green cards asap who knows at this point but it seems extra introduction of many people might mitigate the problemwho want to live like thatgf from years back told me she never wanted to have kids she would tell me stuff

needed to act quickly and made an arrest the fastest way possiblenanmr rosas said starbucks had showed a general disregard for the employees fundamental rights in response to union judge added that the company interrogated and threatened workers and restricted discussion of pay it also repeatedly sent staff to stores in order to more closely supervise monitor or create the impression that employees union activities are under surveillance this sounds like a hell of a lot more than just illegal firing to me ca the judge place some kind of order to make starbucks cease and desist this bullshitif unions were bad the corporations would try so hard to stop them jean gandalfi have a question about unions in the us does every store has to start its union is there no nationwide union for let say all retail workers or all iron workers etcit so easy to find another source of your daily coffee buy a different brand brew it at home and stop giving money to these assholes they quit their shit real quick with the help of people buying elsewhere it one of the most easily replaceable parts of the daydid i miss the part where there was any consequence to starbucks for doing this except perhaps that they shouldn t do it in the future what about the employees that were fired isn t this really about them compensation for lost earnings they are the victimsinb4 starbucks appeals the ruling to get it to trump s supreme court where schultz s judges will side with himas if i needed a reason not to go to starbucks other than the fact that their coffee sucks oh down vote me well starbucks coffee is over roasted bitter trashduh now dissolve themmy gf led the charge on unionizing her starbucks store she kind of spoke on a lot of the things i see happened in this casestarbucks is not great coffee if you are in nyc please go to one of the locally owned barista spots for better coffee at same priceabsolutely toothless until willful violations of nlra and related laws result in jail time for and financial penalties based on revenue this will continue the only other alternative is a mass boycott people refusing to work for them or consumers refusing to spend money me personally i like it better than dunkin which is a very low bar but when i traveling and do know the local coffeeshop scene makes for a basic reliable cup an expensive one for what i get but one that i know wo be burned dirt i have kept my commitment to only buy from union shops when i know where they are and mark those in my appremovedin response starbucks said its actions were lawful and in line with policies except the judge just said it was so the question becomes are you stupid or criminal the answer of course isit fucking stupid how cooperations will do anything to keep people down trying to subvert the law when they know it wo hold up in courtbreaking the shake shack next door employees rejoiceoverpriced shitty coffee anywaywhat if we the workers who far out number the oligarchs were to simply cut the oligarchs outso when is the slap on the wrist fine comingmaybe at some point we will realize that if you need to regulate a system as to not be exploitative towards its workers its not the right system for now lets see how long it takes for the supreme court to overrule thisi like to see these fuckers try this in an eu country they get bitch slapped so hard by the unionsunion drives seem like a pretty good gig these days either you succeed and you improve the lives of working class people or the company retaliates against you and you get to sue them and reap lots of settlement money even in americaaaaand yet millions of people will still go to starbucks for their mocca frappa caffeinated milkshake every daythe coffee chain has been ordered to rehire the and compensate others who were affected how is this any sort of penalty this is even a fine it simply paying what they would paid if they had broken the law it like if you got arrested for a carjacking and rather than going to prison you just had to buy the car you stolehaven t been to that shitshack for decades don t plan on relapsingfine all companies ignoring us labor law and it would be enough to fund universal healthcare or forcibly restructure them as worker owned co opseli5 no judgements here but seriously why is this company so frickin successful in an economy that is so tough on our young working people families and more mature who decides to pay luxury prices for the products starbucks offers i like coffee i drink it every day i wake up and have a cup of instant before my wife rises and we make the daily pot when i get home from work i have the dregs of the morning brew on ice in summer microwaved in the colder months i love the taste the boost and the routine grind coffee and especially instant is expensive to buy in the grocery store but per cup it a fraction of the cost of a coffee at this in my opinion ridiculously expensive chain before you kill me with down votes let me assure you that i understand coffee shops exist for meetings dates and pick me ups with friends got it judging from the explosion of outlets in the us in the last decade there are many many people that frequent starbucks daily alone and at considerable cost and more recently these same people know that the staff that serves them have serious employment issues enjoy your coffeeshare holding when the biggest obstacle to your riches happens to be the people who work for you and trust you i one of the lucky ones i spent all of my savings during a family crises and no longer care about retirement funds and such i do have an urge to burden civilization with greed to steal from the people making my coffee i just going to die broke and i ok with thatwell this isn t going to result in any meaningful penalty starbucks bombed rather hard here in australia it was all over the place then almost nowhere you can get far far better coffee almost anywhereoh look a ruling that means nothingwhoops my badoh good let s give them these career making jobs backan now starbucks has to fire the manager that made that decision and every manager that let it happen and pay court costs fines and compensation to the workers and reinstate thier jobs rightnow hire them back and fire them righti manage a starbucks so i have seen both sides corporate has absolutely acted poorly but the union has also acted poorly and are actively exploiting baristas both sides are wrongnanthat s brutal they specifically went to the fertility clinic to avoid passing on the genebad enough one or more of your staff fcked up but then to turn around and try to hide it instead of coming clean about profits above ethics a tale as old as time and bad as sour winethats terrible that poor child let alone the parents unbelievable that this still happenswe deeply empathize with this family situation hrc said in a statement adding that the diazes wished to have a male embryo transferred which we carried out according to the family explicit wishes and in accordance with the highest level of care can someone please tell them what empathy means because i do not think they knowthey defense was that the couple wanted a male embryo like that superseded the potentially deadly stomach cancer gene what the fuck mani have genetic disorder that causes cancer i d be devastated if this happened to our daughter after pgd and ivf this makes me want to double check now that shes borni hope the family wins and creates a trust fund for their son to have fertility treatment to have as many children as he wants without the genei went to this clinic they screwed up my hormones and messed up my first round then i had to keep putting off implantation because the doctor was in china new booming business i guess i was lucky because i threw such a fit that i m sure they were veey careful during the rest of the processca wait for some republican to tell us that embryo has just as much right to a uterus as any other embryonitpicky correction they did ivf with preimplantation genetic testing looking for the presence of absence of a mutation not the gene itself everyone has two copies of this gene it called cdh1 but those with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome have a mutation in one copy of the gene lazy journalismi make the fertility clinic pay for crispr treatment to remove the gene not sure if that is a thing or allowed yet but i seen it used and other gene therapies used for other generic disordersi wish my autism and learning disability were gene edited outhow do embryos get genetically testedi wonder when it will be required by law that all embryos produced at fertility clinics be edited to avoid inherited diseaseswhile a future with perfect genes seems good it also opens the can of worms that is gene discrimination hello world of gattacathis is really devastating for the family i am sure but i think there is a really significantly high chance that there will be a gene therapy to cure this before the child is old enough for it to impact them it says it wo effect him until early adulthood and it is a single gene people are already getting experimental crispr therapies to fix problems it will likely be mainstream in another 20 yearsdeletedivf should exist in the first placenandoesn t measles spread extremely that s not good hope they got mmr vaccines as

vaccination i was given the vaccine again and a second immunity test later which still showed no immunity no matter how much i want to i ca protect myself or others against measles it highly contagious and you can be spreading the virus a maximum of 2 weeks before showing any symptoms it so ridiculous to not be vaccinated if you have the option even if it does work like in my case i had 2

away lolso if i got my measles vaccine 53 years ago do i need a boosternandid they ever build that one in wisconsinis there a town called india in wisconsinas someone who has worked with manufacturing all over asia i can say with 100 certainty that that india is nothing like any other asian country with regard to manufacturing quality control is a completely foreign concept there working with chinese manufacturers compared to indian ones is like working with people from an entirely different planet examples we found certain an indian electronics manufacturer using filtrete furnace filters that were duct taped to their air intakes typically an entire fairly sophisticated air purification system is needed in electronics manufacturing facilities these guys were using the low end of a regular houses furnace filter they did even spring for the fucking allergen ones not that it would have mattered they letting in thousands of times more particles than they should be and these particles end up messing up the electronics causing rates of failure that destroyed any potential profit another example fully bunny suits are a common thing in electronics manufacturing we found a factory in india having their employees use paint coveralls rubber dishwashing gloves and painter masks the cheap ones no eye covering no restriction on deodorant shampoo and other chemicals people use on themselves that restriction is standard in these facilities making this type of stuff in india is like trying to make a space shuttle in a scrap yardindia smh i hope foxconn goes out of business just scroll down to the post by warlornn he details it perfectlyyou going to lose any savaings on their terrible quality controlfoxconn is the wonderful company that had to install nets at their company town in china to stop workers from committing suicide by jumping off the buildings and they moving to india which is renowned for its great working conditions and labor protections i sure this will be great for everyone involvedrotflmao so much for trump the walking fuckups promise to build a foxconn plant in wisconsin every motherfucker in wisconsin that voted for that chump deserves the fucking unemployment line gullible cheeseheadsi see you all in 20 years when india is leveraging its position as a manufacturing hub to further its interests and power and both our political and business leaders blame everyone but themselvesgood pooh bear can suck itnanremovedi ve known guys that think with their organoid since high school wouldn t call it intelligencethis is awesome we are just beginning to appreciate what we have previously thought of flaws can provide valuable different perspectives an example might be that many color blind people can easily identify camouflage this is a lateral shift what can a brain in a dish tell us it all past me but i m reminded of the following quote albert einstein to charlie chaplin what i most admire about your art is your universality you don t say a word yet the world understands you chaplin true but your glory is even greater the whole world admires you even though they don t understand a word of what you sayi was just thinking that the next ethical issue is gon na be using organisms to compute ie massive farms filled with critters because it happens to turn out that organics are the next step beyond mineral based computingremovedbiocomputing sounds better than organoid intelligencethis sounds like old let s cut up some brains and attach the pieces to circuits so we don t have to understand how they workcylons you are on step 1 of creating cylonshow about rectal intelligence pulling the answers out of your assremovedso i was listening to a report today an ai trained as a fighter pilot basically beat the shit out of all it human opponents skynet is comingyep yep we just setting ourselves up to be outdone by another lifeform in about years that may not be a bad thing if they collectively have more common sense than usremovedis this exactly what the machines in the matrix used humans for in the original script i guess that means that ohio first turned the skies blacklem me guess if not on an actual giant mainframe computer there will be human beings also doing the job whether at the actual facility or in the world walking around helping with processing power a little bit by being hooked up to this digital grid somehow pretty sure deus ex human revolution had the human beings being organoid intelligence in a facility part down i guess the other part we are already doing it somewhat with phones and all wonder if they injected some of those things they talk about into people to test it is a cluster of chips and actual neurons after all and pen sized creepyif it is intelligence surely it is artificial intelligence no matter if it is organic or whatever elsewell now they just fucking with usdefinitely not new i been watching bio computers for many a year with bio switches and bio processing i glad to see it been getting some attention thoughprepare to panic in oh maybe fifty years or soyou wan na make mother brain because this is how you do itthis gives a whole new spin on the concept of a computer virusskimmed the article and while maybe some of this is new for the most part this field has been around for awhile now i remember vaguely many years ago there was a news story about some scientists training a group of neurons to maintain stable flight of an airplane these biological cells in a petri dish nutrient bath for computing this could be moderately useful if they ever got the science down to a point where making the processor was easy but it still probably have inherent problems in certain cases ex these things need nutrients to work imagine having a car that can truly autopilot you but then you lose the capability because you forgot to refill the nutrient fuel for your car brain and it died literallyi would put robots in charge

sgrammar police zoom porn bomb or porn zoom bombnani left my field helping care for children because one maladjusted kid hit me in the head from behind with an aluminum baseball bat i was told that after recovering i would be put back with the same kid fuck that i quit on the spoti worked as a aide for many years and it can be very scary with someone his size and height we tried to put him with male paraprofessional workers hope shes ok and he gets the help he needs i worked with high school kids but they were on a 2nd grade level listening to him speak mentally he was way behind as wellnot in the us but how is the poor teacher who was attacked is she going to be okay or does she have life changing injuries i m talking physically not mentallymy partner has worked as a paraeducator there is a shoestring budget to accommodate the kids and she s in a good district these kids need professional therapy services but they get partitioned off and handheld through education while teachers walk on eggshells because their training is effectively good luck they re swept under the rug instead of actually treated it s a tragic cycledamn one million dollar that s a lot of nintendo switchessaw an article recently that said she didn t even take his nintendo switch so this just looks like he wanted to kill this woman he s already said he will try to kill her againwhy is he charged with attempted murder he just kept on hitting and kicking after she was knocked out he was trying to kill herthis kid had 3 prior batteries iirc the state failed that kid and the teacher he obviously has a psychosis that would warrant specialized care or isolation that would never put that teacher in jeopardy to begin with his actions are deplorable and should absolutely be dealt with but let not act this country takes mental health seriously and everything that could been done to avoid these situations was done we continually fail our youth and will continually see this more and morethat marine had very poor situational awarenessis that a marine in uniform being fucking uselesskid should have been at an institution that could handle his issues i going to take a wild guess and say that the florida state government decided to cut back on funding for special needs individuals and put the burden on teachers who were not able to handle themthat kid should have been a classroom at all special ed or otherwise he a danger to society and should have been segregated for whatever help he had coming for his problems it could have been anybody that he attackedi watched the video it is crazy that they said he may be facing possible expulsion and then that he threatened to kill her when he gets out if i were her assuming she is still alive and capable of thought following this would retire the second i woke up i hope she is ok and that the kid gets the help he so clearly needs chances are though he ll just be sent to jail and the people there will be forced to deal with his behaviori don t care if he s special needs i support this dangerous people are dangerous regardless of why they did it not everyone can be fixedthe initial attack should have been the moment he realized he gone too far but instead he went from a massive overreaction that his impulse control issues did consider before shoving his victim to a attempted murder i a pretty progressive cat when it comes to charging minors but there is something so broken in this person that i not sure they can ever be rehabilitated mind you my mother was a teacher aide dealing with troubled kids for two decades she was bitten and spit on several times thankfully none of them were massive people who could murder her for taking away their toygood it needs to happen a hell of a lot more oftensee you in kidwhen the video first dropped a bunch of people tried to argue that he was going to juvie and be released in months i had to explain to several people that an underaged person getting turned over to juvenile crime does mean he is going to be tried as a child a 17 year old catching a felony is an easy adult callremovedgood take his switch away forever and lock him up for the rest of his life currently the max for this crime is 30 years but given his violent nature and impulse control he will fuck up enough in prison to keep him there for lifeas he should he s old enough and 6 6 he s dangerous as hell and should be supervised by large malesneeds ol sparky not 1m bondhis life is basically overi would have even given him thatyou are either an adult with the rights and responsibilities that come with it or you are not the government should not be able to pick and choose when it is convenient for themi find it disturbing how many people in this thread simultaneously hold the positions that the kid is not in full control of his mental faculties and also that he should be tried for this crime as an adult the right of children to face charges specific to children instead of charges specific to adults should not hinge on how angry their crime makes us nor should we undercut the established ages of those charges on the basis that they should have know better or i knew better at that ageflorida always floridadeletedremovedgood that he being charged as an adult but i feel like this bond perfectly demonstrates why that system is fucked people accused of much worse crimes get much lower bonds and rich people get to go free while the poor are left to suffer in jaildeletedshould have been a cop he would have got less1 million bond lol that kid is not a flight risk but he does have some serious issuesnot trying to advocate for the dude he might have a case with the administration not segregating not sure what better word to use from the gen ed it also about keeping teachers and students safethis reminded me of watching armed and armored police knocking unarmed women and people in wheelchairs down during blm protests i feel horrible for the teacher and also the parents of this doomed childand what will happen to the school that created this environmenthe s special needs this is fucked up edit all of the disgusting ignorant hateful shitheads in this thread are a perfect example of how bad our education system is you re ghoulsdude ground pounded her mma stylestop charging kids as adults at 18 the brain is still not fully mature prior to that it certainly isn ti seem to be the only one asking what brought this on why did he do this then upon hearing what started it her taking a 300 piece of electronics away from him theft in an amount that equals a felony realized that he was well within florida statutes and if i was on the jury unless there are details we don t know there almost certainly are so let s hear em he did nothing illegal i won t say nothing wrong but he was well within the allowed response by law with the information we have right nownanoh this guy the picture is accurate dude be cray crayoh look he ran for congress in illinois huge surprisetwo manhattan residents are facing felony charges related to the misuse of covid relief funds jeffrey regnier and greta keranen are facing 24 different felony counts which range from wire fraud to money laundering where is it i know it there somewhere federal authorities say that the two defendants used their new lenox based business kee firearms to fraudulently access pandemic relief funds regnier also ran congress in 2022 in illinois first congressional district but lost in the republican primary there it islmao here i thought atf was raiding the gun shop for some big fuck up or nope misuse of ppp loans so many dumbasses took advantage of those loans during covid and misused them not at all surprisedfor fucks sake the article is about misuse of covid relief funds the fact it a gun shop is incidentali guess in this story the federal agents are the good guys with gunshe got that goofy maga will save me somehow look on his dumbass facesurprised he lost his primary with this resumesounds like a perfect politician how is he not right next to mtgoh no a gun shop owner was raided by federal agents he must have been selling guns to children or known felons or trafficking in unregistered firearms or no they committed fraud with covid relief funds the fact they own a gun store is completely coincidental and their crimes are related to firearms in any way they could have committed the same kind of fraud if they owned a restaurant or a fabric store or any other kind of business you know like many many owners of other kinds of businesses did but no we got ta have that disingenuous sensationalistic headline to get the clicks no one gives a shit or would bother reading about just another nobody small business owner misusing covid funds fuck wjol they can bite my shiny metal assfitting for a republicannanthis part a little crazy kid lived long enough to go see the nurse talk to the cops and be taken to the hospital probably bleeding out internally and did even know it both those students left the classroom started to assess their injuries and went to the school office to speak with the school nurse police said officers immediately contacted the students who were both were alert and conscious when they provided police with their initial stabbing victims were taken to a local hospital where one of them died from his injuriesso a freshman was confronted by two older students took out a knife and stabbed them both one died that s crazyuh wait so the two dudes who ended up being stabbed went to the nurse office at some point the police arrives police collects statements from them finally they are transported to the hospital am i the only one seeing a problem with that particular ordering of steps yes those two dudes seem to have been bullies but when you have somebody with stabbing wounds you get them to the hospital firstit s so unfortunate that someone had to die but the proceedings in this case will be interesting sounds like but the fact the kid had a knife at school might put cause him to still face some charges maybe not murder but some lesser chargeshe minded his own business he did good in school he was one of the sweetest most lovable kindest cutest most did deserve any of this she said nobody saw this coming it an absolute tragedy and a loss does sound like he was minding his own business when they went after a freshmen in an art class they were even supposed to be in he did deserve to die but looks like he went looking for trouble and it found him edit the article does say the kid who slashed the tires was the kid who did the stabbing it just states that the school does do enough that they did nothing in an instance where tires were slashedwhen i was in high school the girls field hockey team started bullying a girl in my class the girl had long brown hair that hung in her face she was thin and quiet hardly had any friends the of stocky up with her cornered her in a dark hallway the girl being bullied laid them out she was thrown out of school months of bullying had her scared enough to have two rolls of quarters in her pockets she wrapped her fists around them fought a fair fight one 115 girl against girls that weighed easily 160 plus she was my hero and years after high school ended her i crossed paths at college she had her ged bought her own house was paying her way through school 30 years later she still impressed me that day if you bully someone expect to someday lose big and the school back then did nothing to protect her nothing has changedmy dad grew up in chicago and among the things that my dad told me that stuck with me and probably saved my life were these things time you fight you take your life and someone else into your own hands have no concept of how long life is guys end up in one of two places in prison or in a grave you can be anything you want to be and there are better things to fight forwe did even think about going to school administration when we knew much stronger tougher kids were out to get us it was obvious even back when i was in high school that schools were going to protect anybody from the worst kidsa boy brought a knife to school because he knew he would get jumped and no one would protect him a student called 911 when he stabbed the 2 kids who tried to assault himhad this happen to a friend of mine in highschoo when i was in middle school dude was bullied hard and when the kid finally snapped he ended up stabbing the bully he was demonized for attacking the bully and the bullies family played victim if the stories i heard after were true bully deserved iti not saying those kids deserved what happened to them but it honestly sounds like they were the instigators in the situationsounds like self defense honestly guy was gon na get his ass beat by 2 dudes idkabout 30 years ago my cousin and his friends confronted a kid they did like they were the aggressors when they started attacking the guy he stabbed all but one of them killing 2 he was found not guiltythey responded to the school with over thirty officers christbet those 2 juniors felt mighty tough planning to jump a freshman not a big leap to believe the kid was in fear for his lifewonder if this is another case of the school ignoring bullying until someone snappedif i was this kid and i got charged with something i would take it all the way to jury trial i see no way 12 people would vote to convict under these circumstancesthe way i see it the school is at fault for everything here contingent on the assumptions being made being true they failed to prevent what sounds like an ongoing case of physical harassment and bullying they failed to prevent a fight from escalating to armed conflict leading to the death of a student if this was a sudden one off with the kid escalating to a knife out of nowhere and stabbing two kids minding their own business that one thing but it far more likely this was a long term problem that got ignored out of apathy or convenience at the end of the day this is a tragedy for everyone involved but i inclined to believe until actual details prove otherwisehe minded his own business he did good in school he was one of the sweetest most lovable kindest cutest most i m so fucking tired of people making excuses for shitty behavior he wasn t any of these things when he cornered and outnumbered a kid two years his juniorpublic school system does nothing about bullying gets surprised when it results in antisocial violent behaviori have so many questions why were those two students able to walk into another classroom and confront someone was there a teacher supervising the class why did the police take statements before the injured students were taken to the hospital howso fucked that kid felt the need to bring a knife to school and stab his abusers i hate that the situation came down to this i wish the school system saved these kids from this nightmarethat s just so sad for everyone involved a child died another stabbed and a third has probably ruined his future over the schools failuresummary student a and student b attack student teachers attempt to break up the fight unsuccessfully student c defends himself with a contraband knife stabbing students a and b student a dies from his injuries student c flees but is arrested without incident what was happening prior to this that student c felt the need to bring a knife to school why were students a and b allowed to enter a classroom that they were not apparently students inso two juniors entered a classroom not there own to confront a freshman sounds like a couple of bullieswow wtf do you do in this situation get beat up so bad you spoon fed by your parents forever or bring a weapon and disrupt some bullies i take my chances with the knife the word bully does go over too easily with a jury these days2 kids attacked a 3rd and got stabbed for it one of the perps died and the other was kid with the knife was the victim apparently i hope the survivor has learned a valuable life lessonthis is why you don t bully peoplebullies suck school fights suck but this is the delicious justice you think it is its just all sadi a california high school teacher and have been for over 12 years there is zero discipline in california high schools districts get dinged by the state for suspensions and wo suspend anyone for any reason kids get in fights talk it out in the administrators office get fed cookies and chips and then sent back to class what happens behaviors have gotten significantly worse since the start of these programs which began august 2022 we had a kid threaten a teacher and bring a 10 in hack saw to school no suspension or expulsion he served 2 days of on campus wellness where he sat in a beanbag chair in our wellness room where he listened to music and hung out on his phone california please can we elect sane people who will make sensible policies for education i ca remain a teacher if this nonsense continuesbuckle up if you wish it turns out this was a rant 2 kids years old cornered a younger kid years old those are ages where there can be a crazy difference in development physical emotional and mental this incident happened in a school environment where there must have been some indicator that there was bullying and an overall threat level that i d like to think we wouldn t tolerate in any other civilized society or organization no part of any part of the incident or immediate emergency response escalation was handled by anyone with a fully developed brain it doesn t go deep enough to say that the school should at least somewhat liable here it s not like most schools have or properly dictate resources to actually mitigating serious bullying issues having had the fortunate experience of attending a high school where there was a really solid counsellor to student ratio who were good and at least one counsellor would know each student really well it helped partially because collectively they had a good picture of the dynamics going on within the school at any given time partially because it was decent mental health care and they d actively work with each kid to their own success had a problem in a class they d hear you out and get to the root of the issue on to actioning it if the student was ok with the next steps whether it was problems at home extra academic help needing to be in an accelerated class separation from a peer or beef with a teacher all in all it seemed to help prevent any sort of serious issue from happening it was a far more peaceful high school experience than most i hope all of the kids involved receive really good counselling like right away these are some very young psyches that lived through a very traumatic situation they are doing so at a time when extreme violence in schools is such a constant all while their brains are developing the school already failed these kids here most schools would never stand the chance because they don t have anywhere close to the resources necessary i hope they aren t let down again the next best chance they have is to start getting good help now mental and legal to process navigate living in the aftermaththe kids are not alrightthis is both a tragedy and a case of fafo they are mutually exclusivewhen asked if there was an issue with the school not doing enough to mitigate conflict between students one of the family members said the school did do anything they did nothing they were reported to last week when tires were slashed and there were confrontations but they did do anything they did document it they did call parents they did even call the parents today school kids called the parents today to let them know their son had just been stabbed said the grandmother on of the example of neglicence by the school this just keeps getting worse and worse the more you read it what a tragedy all aroundnow they will have councilors available for the kids who did nothing while he was being bullied the kids that bullied him or stood by will now organize a walkout and a memorialthis article tries to make the slain teen out to be an angel but two upper class kids attacked a freshmen they also did it so boldly by entering a different classroom that also had a teacher in it while i do know the facts that indicates to me those two kids meant business and had no fear of school staff imagine you are that freshman i would have been terrified should he have had a knife i would like to say no but i will tell you in my junior high almost all the kids carried box cutters and they were terrifying kids i used to carry mace in my hand in my pocket whenever i was in the halls because there were that many truly dangerous kids at that school i suspect that kid could launch a decent self defense case if the family can get a lawyer however i suspect not and this will be a continuing tragedyim so sick and tired of people acting so surprised and clueless about this shit where were the teachers why could they just walk into a classroom because the whole system sucks fucking balls teachers cant do shit students have to take everything im their own hands and this generation is way more comfortable with doing some crazy shit like walking into a classroom to jump a kid theres your answers now please stop asking i cant say whether or not i brought a knife with me every day to school but ill say id rather not be caught lackinghe was a good boy a quiet and gentle boy he did not harm anybody this is so out of character for something like this to happen to him i do understand said jaden grandmother cheryl he minded his own business he did good in school he was one of the sweetest most lovable kindest cutest most did deserve any of this she said nobody saw this coming it an absolute tragedy and a loss he literally attacked a younger kid with his buddy sounds like you did know your grandson cheryl2 guys were going to jump him and he took one of them out good for him hope he gets offi would say when someone was stabbed that it a little more than a fightthe appropriate response to being threatened with a knife is to run nobody escapes a knife fight without serious injuries i used to do historical martial arts i wasn t very good one day a modern knife fighting instructor visited and we did some drills and some full speed sparring using rubber knives and protective gear i remember being alarmed at how successful i was against the instructor comparatively with a long sword my success rate against the instructors would ve been a rounding error from 0 if they tried i lost conclusively every time against the knife instructor i had a success rate of maybe 30 many of which would have yielded fatal wounds if it were real and remember i wasn t good knives are just that scarythis reads like what am i missing that caused him to get arrestedlocal hs had a kid get punched hit his head on the floor and died everyone who knew nothing wanted the puncher to to hang turned out the kid had been attacking and harassing other kids for weeks he tried again and the one self defense punch ended up killing the aggressor all of a sudden nobody felt bad anymore he got what was coming it seems to me most schools are ill equipped to handle problem children they should be removed so that normal students can have a safe environmentpolice said two male students who were juniors entered a classroom where an art class was being held and confronted a male freshman student x200b he was a good boy a quiet and gentle boy he did not harm anybody said jaden grandmother cheryl jaden aunt described the teen as a great kid and said there was nothing they could have done to stop the deadly incident he minded his own business the victim family is delusional while these things about the student that was killed may be true that is not who he was on this particular day and the facts of the incident are the facts he and his friend went into another student class with the intention of assaulting that student but there was nothing they could have done to stop the deadly incident okay it unfortunate that a student was killed the administration failed these three students horribly my heart is broken for the suspect that now has to carry the burden of having taken someone life when he was trying to defend himself from two bullieshold on the deceased kid was stabbed and they sent him to the school nurseokay so this isn t a fight it is a stabbing need to update the titlesucks that our justice and school system is fucked up defending yourself from harm gets you in hot waterwelcome to america where your school system couldn t give a fuck less about you i m not condoning what this kid did but i sure as fuck understand where he was coming from36 officers if it was a gun we would have had 12 and they would have stayed outside the whole time debating wether to go inthere was a big deal about something like this in the 90s i don t remember the name of the school but the boy s name was jeremy he gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady s breast how could i forget then he hit me with a surprised leftso two students came in looking for trouble noting they were older as well the 15 year old should have done what because after he produced the knife the two kids didn t immediately leave so the kid has a defense here that he was defending himself from imminent dangerfafo don t assault people and you will not get stabbed in retaliationin 8th grade i got into an argument with a kid named danny he stole all of my pens and pencils out of my backpack so that i could do my work back then if you did have your own teachers would look at you like you were such a disappointment a disaster and letting you borrow a pencil was like such a huge inconvenience for them the teacher gave me a brand new pencil and told all of the students that they have to wait for me to go sharpen it with the manual sharpener before we could start our work after class i went straight up to danny and pushed him with one hand so hard that he fell on his ass he looked at me in shock and everyone laughed after school danny and his friend followed me walking a mile home while egging me to fight them i was stupid enough to fight 2 vs 1 i walked fast and did not engage or talk to them when i had gotten to about 100ft of my house they suddenly turned and disappeared the next day i was called to the principal office he asked me why i pushed danny i explained but he did seem to believe me he asked me now why would danny steal your pencils they followed you home but did try to hurt you he said that i should stay away from danny that he a known gang member and it better if i try not to upset him i felt like there was no one on my side so i had to take care of myself the next day i came to school with a knife in my backpack if danny was a gang member then i had to adequately protect myself i was fine with fighting him 1 vs 1 he was fat and short but strong i would have only taken out the knife if it ended up being 2 vs 1 again after school i walked home slowly like half speed waiting for him to catch up to me but he never came i never had another with him again i did laugh my ass off when we all moved to high school and i found out he got held back a yearwhen will we address that violence in schools is a cultural issue that starts at being addressed at home the actual school itself is being used as a scapegoat do we really expect schools to be the sole responsible party in keeping kids safe there are not enough for that it has to be a shared responsibility among the students staff and parents if we let the schools solve the problems then they will get treated like prisons because eventually kid safety will be more of a priority then the education itself if a child was taught that education was important and that the institution of school should be respected then i think it would be looked at less as an acceptable battlefield for school dramassounds like somebody found out loss of life at this age is tragic thoughthe system would rather the kid die than defend himselfi never understood how school fights are tolerated it a school not a prisonfun fact bullies who threaten violence gang up on one kid and enjoy menacing kids who are studying are also shameless liars who always blame the victim and deny any responsibility for what they themselves have doneso the kid was defending himself from two people who were older and bigger than himself good for him i was bullied relentlessly for my entire childhood and never really stood up for myself but once or twice tragic that a life was lost especially so young but you play stupid games you win stupid prizes hard to have empathy for someone who s a total shitbag that goes out of their way to make other people s lives miserablepacked a shank up in my when i started kindergartenmy younger siblings went here and every other day my brother was coming home from kids wanting to fight him just cus he was kind of a big kid and many times my sisters would have to intervene and cause a big enough scene for the staff to do anything this school should be held accountable 100i came very close to a similar situation in high school i went to a shit school the bullying and harassment was fucked up more than once i come home from school with fractures even broken bones that how fucked it was second year of high school i started carrying a pocket knife with me and i think the worst of the kids that fucked with me realized something was up because they started to back off more and when something did go down i have it there and ask myself if this was it if this was the day i wanted to basically ruin my life and thankfully that day never came to pass but i come close a few times it sucks that a kid died over this but from what little we as outside parties know it sounds like they sought this kid out to provoke a confrontation two bigger older kids on one he did jump them with a knife in a dark alley i bet my money on him having that knife for protectionhe was a good boy a quiet and gentle boy he did not harm anybody this is so out of character for something like this to happen to him i do understand said jaden grandmother cheryl i know it family and emotions are high but what happened does kinda contradict that i was a quiet kid and would never even think about confronting someone younger than me in another classthis system that we have put children in breaks my heart almost every dayi wonder if they were bullying the 15 year old and he acted in self defensefuck em two 16 year olds tried to jump a freshmansounds like the school and cops should have a crash course on victims of stabbings get them to a hospital yeah i know they were the bullies but they do deserve deathseems like they did treat the stab wounds with due urgency it easy to be badly injured and not realize how bad it is knowing that there was a stabbing i think the ambulance should have been dispatched at the same time they sent the cops i sure the 911 operator will receive a corrective action memo over this onehe was a good boy a quiet and gentle boy jayden aunt renee helm described the teen as a great kid and said there was nothing they could have done to stop the deadly incident in an update wednesday afternoon police said two male students who were juniors entered a classroom where an art class was being held and confronted a male freshman student yeah just innocently bringing a buddy along to a classroom you do belong in to beat up a younger studentgreat kid minded his own business does good in school but yet he and another friend went into a classroom that they didn t belong in to harass another student this is very tragic for everyone the family of the suspect and the families of the 2 victims especially jaden s family jaden s family is suffering the loss of their at such a young age the suspect has to live with that fact his entire life sending out positive vibes and good energy to everyone affected in this tragedywell hope this is a lesson to all bullies do underestimate your enemywait so the kids who died started the fight the two 16 year olds confronted the one 15 year old in a classroom where the fuck was the faculty hereit would not surprise me to learn that the older boys were bullying the kid who stabbed them they went after him two against one and he clearly felt he needed to defend himself i wonder if school officials or teachers were aware if they do anything to stop or mitigate bullying behavior when it s reported or if they look the other way sad all the way arounddamn i pass that school every day on my commute it s just a few blocks from my house guy i know taught there this is so fucking sad so many people in this thread have their justice boners out but all three of these boys are just kids so many people do stupid shit when they re 16 and it doesn t involve someone dying i feel awful for both survivors and everyone at that school just kids man i ve taught sophomores and seniors no matter how old they seem or think they are they re just kids this is such a tragedy all aroundman this is such a conflicting situation nobody wants to take a beating but living with killing someone instead of that beating is a other worldly trade off i got my ass kicked as a teen by older kids being bullies but i m sure glad i never stabbed anyonefirst off even though they are bullies it quite unfortunate that one of them died second this should be another reason why bullying needs to be addressed in schools if you see something say something it terrible there been so many shootings but kids dying due to bullying related issues is crazy i sorry but the reality that young people who have even reached adulthood are dying just makes my stomach turnyou go jump a younger kid that just happens to have a knife to defend himself this is just pure karmahmmm this is a tricky one 1 kid had a 5 inch blade on him in school 2 tires were slashed 3 two juniors walked up to the freshman so they were the aggressors in the situation if that kid really did slash their tires then i can understand why they were frustrated cause tires ain t cheap but if he didn t they just look like straight up assholes only kids at that school will know what really happened so until then can t really blame the kid for defending himselfbullied kid defends himself against 2 older attackers fixed the headlinemaybe they deserved it sounds like self defense sucks that he died but one less bully in the world is nothing i ll lose sleep overi hope they take into consideration that the one who died was able to go to the nurse office and also give a statement to police before going to the hospital the delay in proper care appears to have contributed to the outcome for that reason i think a murder charge is inappropriate the school should be held responsible as wellbe the bully dont be surprised when you find the lion who eats youplot twist they were confronting him about their desire to not get stabbed to deathdo show up to a knife fight with your fistsso the social justice experiment of not disciplining kids in school to avoid the imaginary school to prison pipeline actually has consequences school violence is way up and administrators turn a blind eye test scores keep falling because disruptive students don t get disciplined and cost all the other students a chance at an education pure stupidityso two juniors bully a freshman who declined to be assaulted and defends himself and everyone is so sad that a bully got put down he minded his own business he did good in school he was one of the sweetest most lovable kindest cutest most did deserve any of this she said nobody saw this coming it an absolute tragedy and a loss people minding their own business do grab a wingman to roll into someone classroom to start shit with a freshmannancan t be a cross border raid if they are already fighting in russiaputin we do not recognize ukraine as a sovereign nation all of ukraine is part of russia part of the motherland also putin ukrainians illegally crossed the border into russia to carry out a violent act of sabotage vlad seems to want it both ways what a muppetok putin you started a war did you really think nobody would try to attack you back you been raining missiles down on schools hospitals and residential areas for over a year now you are surprised and unhappy somebody fought backthe audacity of ukraine how dare they fight back against us invading them and murdering civiliansit sure was a mistake to invade ukraineit been less than 24 hours since the most recent report that russia is sloppily planning attacks within its own borders but go onthe alleged incursion came just days after putin ordered the federal security service to tighten controls on russia s border with ukraine well that does seem like a way to endorse your security service now does it they infiltrated the area near the border and opened fire on civilians putin said during a video call they saw a civilian vehicle with civilians with children in it and they fired on this is how we know the story is bullshit we have proof of russians doing similar things thoughjust because you call it a special military operation does not mean it is a war lol i love how mordor thinks that their orc lands can not be raided due to some imaginary rulesthis is the bully starting a fight then crying when they get hiti hope ukraine actually did it sneaky fucking russiansin before the numbers crowd gets here and starts blaming the us for forever wars slava ukrainithis is a thing russia thinks countries it invading should be allowed to dowho cares if they did get out of their country and they won t need to retaliategood still awaiting putin assassination to end this it the only way he on the way out and wants to leave a legacydid russia forget that it fighting a warrussia are such wimpsuh isn t that what russia has been doing for the past yearand get your troops out of ukraine then you can complainare they not at war with each other right now specifically because russia invaded ukraine im guessing this is nonsense for their population and their supporters abroadperhaps handing out russian passports to locals in the occupied territories has some consequencesrussia would never attack itself and blame it on ukraine fffffbwahahahahahahahahahah sorry could keep a straight face after typing thathow stupid can you be your bully ass invaded another country danced around your reasons as to why then cry foul when the little kid in the school yard starts hitting backi just waiting for ukraine to drop a drone strike down on the kremlin hopefully with putin still in itborders are not something that russia respects so why should anyone elseeven if it is true you get to fight back when you are invadedfirst of all if you invade a country like russia invaded ukraine all is fair in war putin should also should take a good look at his friend lukashenko this has his fingerprints all over itfuck slava ukraini heroiam slavagod forbid if ukraine brought the war russia started to russia clutch those pearls tighter putinistasthose were sabotagers they were special operation party crashersseriously does russia want to be called kettle or potthey do even have the abrams yet lol gon na be a wild year for vladso like russia is accusing ukraine of let me check these notes ah yes war weirdwhat does it matter russia you re at war with your neighbor but cry foul any chance you can when the nation you invaded slaps you back rightthe russians sorely deserve to be counterattacked at home regardless of whether or not this was one suchvibe mom she hit me but he hit me first did you hit her first yea but she had her pinky on my side of the back seatanything that goes wrong within russia will be blamed on ukraine this is to make the russian people afraid and keep putin in power as he presents himself as the only one to stand up to ukrainian aggression to the motherland leaving out the part were he started itwho the fuck cares i wish they wouldrussia you can t cross our boarder only we can cross the boarder this is are mean military operationentire free world accuses russia of illegal cross border invasion in feburary 2022russia claims a lot of bold lies gon na need a better source like some chalk on the road at this pointlike a ukrainian dirty dozen righteousunfortunately if kyiv denies it it might not be truewell its not like an invasion or anythingwas a raid just special vacation operationrussia claims ukraine held a village hostage while they hold the entire country of ukraine hostagenanmy wife once consoled me on a flight after my inexplicably becoming very unsettled during some rather distressing turbulence i d never felt quite that way on a flight before but my anxiety on this occasion was marked and i was freaked out to say the least she told me to compare the turbulence to being on a boat riding the waves with their troughs and peaks and not to worry having grown up on a large lake in northern ontario i was very familiar with that experience that essentially instead of bounding along the surface in a boat we were riding the air waves and as safe as all that it worked as a physical metaphor and became much more manageable in my mind and not nearly so threatening to compare it like this plus it s true and some turbulence is expected on most flights and any coping strategy is a good strategy as there s nowhere to escape to but i d been with a friend many years ago in his cessna flying high above toronto when we suddenly hit a thermal the small two seater plane dropped about 200 feet in a second and a half and startled us both the rest of the flight was uneventful but what these people went through would make anyone shit their shorts riding the waves would be like encountering a tsunami on an dinghy no bloody thanks i m glad they re all safe that s truly a frightening and dangerous experience i don t even think i d be able toi fly all of the time and this would have me racing to the doctor for a klonopin scrip my greatest fear i am in the wrong profession lolthis definitely sounds like severe turb but i highly doubt they plummeted 1000 feet like the lady claims loli hate turbulence this would have left me pissing myself and i do think i exaggerating i know logically the plane is fine but my brain does like it and my anxiety just goes i to hyperdrive i tried visualization relaxing music etc and that does help somewhat but this sort of turbulence is my nightmarethey should have had their seat belts onzimmerman who is from austin and five months pregnant told cnn she had just finished eating and was about to go to the lavatory when the turbulence hit during dinner service there suddenly was a wind shear the plane increased altitude then we fell feet she said it was like unexpectedly for five seconds off the top of a rollercoaster plates and glassware were up at the ceiling and my purse from the floor flew behind me to the i m glad for the most part we are all ok this was pretty shocking said zimmerman there was a moment of oh my god am i going to meet my holy shit i hope no one was seriously injuredis it weird to love turbulence it s better than a rollercoasternanthe lady doth protest too muchamateur rudy giuliani maybesame goes for bill lee in tennessee these guys really are some two faced liarsi have a question for any attorneys who might read this or really anyone who knows the answer to this wo all of these bills banning drag performances be immediately overturned on 1st amendment grounds the 1st amendment protects freedom of expression from government interference noexpect the well that was all in good fun and completely refuse to comprehend the responding exactlydeletedwhy the fuck is it every single one of these guys leading the anti drag bullshit ends up having appeared in drag and there visual proofhttps video appears to show texas drag bill author dressed in drag a social media user shared a video that appears to show texas state nate schatzline wearing a black sequined dress while skipping through a park a texas lawmaker who authored a bill that would restrict drag performances appears to have dressed in drag himself while a student a video that surfaced on twitter and tiktok this week appears to show texas state nate schatzline a republican skipping running and dancing in a park while donning a black sequined dress and a red eye mask at the end of the roughly video which plays over the song sexy lady by javi mula the four participants are named including schatzline whose character is called the nate schatzline has made his entire personality attacking the lgbtq community trans especially children and vowed to ban drag shows in texas the twitter user who did not respond to a request for comment wrote here is in schatzline a state representative and former pastor did not immediately respond to nbc news request for comment however in a tweet shared tuesday he appeared to confirm his participation in the video y all really going crazy over me wearing a dress as a joke back in school for a theatre project yah that s not a sexually explicit drag lol y all will twist anything he wrote while schatzline s performance in the video would meet most dictionary definitions of drag it is unclear whether it would be prohibited under the legislation schatzline introduced in january the legislation hb 1266 seeks to amend texas business and commerce code to define a venue that hosts a drag performance and authorizes consumption of alcoholic beverages as a sexually oriented such businesses according to the state code may not allow an individual younger than 18 years of age to enter the premises of the the measure defines a drag performance as a performance in which a performer exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer s gender assigned at birth using clothing makeup or other physical markers and sings lip syncs dances or otherwise performs before an audience for it also states that sexually oriented businesses can be categorized as a nightclub bar restaurant or other commercial enterprise that provides for an audience of two or more individuals a drag nate schatzline texas state nate schatzline lawmakers in at least a dozen other states have proposed laws that would similarly restrict drag performances according to an nbc news analysis supporters of these bills say they are needed to protect children from exposure to inappropriate entertainment critics argue that they unfairly target an art form with deep ties to the lgbtq community and wrongly paint all drag performances as obscene atlanta black church is source of solace for lgbtq youth i look over and see my the emergence of schatzline s video came several days after an image of what appears to be tennessee gov bill lee dressed in drag as a high school student was shared on reddit and twitter lee s press secretary jade cooper byers did not confirm whether it is lee in the yearbook photo previously telling nbc news in an email that any attempt to conflate this serious issue with lighthearted school traditions is dishonest and disrespectful to tennessee answering reporters questions monday lee a republican confirmed that he would sign a recently passed bill that would criminalize drag performances in public and in front of children in the state the video of the texas lawmaker also comes about a month after an image emerged on social media that appeared to show embattled republican george santos of new york in drag at the time santos told reporters as he walked through a new york airport no i was not a drag queen in brazil guys i was young and i had fun at a festival sue me for having a lifey all really going crazy over me wearing a dress as a joke back in school for a theatre project that like the whole thing drag is funny it not inherently sexual like conservatives are trying to make it out to be name a kids show back in the 90s and 00s and there probably an episode of one of the main characters in drag for laughsare they coming for women who wear pants next we all know when god created women as an afterthought she was certainly not wearing the masculine pants of adam or godbut this is differentwhile these bills ostensibly targets drag queens and kings it seems clear to me that these kinds of laws are intended to target transgender individuals being anywhere where children conceivably might be present this type of legislation targets public drag performances but it not a huge logical leap to then claim that a trans individual is performing as a member of the opposite biological sex simply by being in public while dressing and acting in accordance with their identified gendergaslight obstruct projecttwo days and i already see 2 cases of panic morons doing the exact thing they want to ban everyone else from doing this the gay panic all over again self hate brewing into thinking as long as you oppress yourself you be acceptedremovedlook at the picture they have of him if it doesn t make your gaydar go off i don t know what willall fun and games until you caught at the birdcagejust looking at the dudes picture says he s got a lot of skeletons in his closety all really going crazy over me wearing a dress as a joke back in school for a theatre project he deserves some sort of award for ability to miss the point yeah drag is a theater thing it a costume you playing a part congratulations on forgetting that somewhere along the line except when you need to pretend that you doing it is totally different from anyone else doing it i supposeformer pastor trying real hard hereit s exactly like uber religious people cover the women so the men aren t tempted outlaw porn so the men aren t corrupted forbid drag so i won t want to put on a dresshomie is hoping that his urges will go away if drag shows just become illegalbut guys this is different you see when he dressed in drag he was just doing it for fun like i said it s different or something seriously though that was his argument that he was just having fun i want to know what he thinks the purpose of drag shows typically is if it s not fundrag for me not for thee it the conservative waythis law is going to be selectively applied to people the current batch of fascists dislike anyone they consider respectable will never be prosecuted for the same actions just like their fucking abortion bansthis would be so funny if it were also so sadhe kinda looks like a sissyah yes the i get to do it but you ca loser partyif a guy claims people doing drag are pedophiles and said guy has doneits always projection with these goppy fascist fucksimo the idea of hypocrisy is focused on too much in media and it only leads to unproductive conversations in this situation it s framed as if the hypocrisy of crossdressing and holding extremist views is the problem as if it would be okay to have those views if he didnt crossdress once in the past it s a pointless argument that shifts the conversation away from the actual issue and towards personal bullshit it s not a moral crime to be a hypocrite but it is morally reprehensible to target a marginalized group for expressing themselves for fun so lets focus on that partremovedhe s just mad he s been auditioning for drag race every year and hasn t been pickedi always thought that if i had nice teeth i d have a great smile i guess that s not always the casethere can be only onetypical maga lying piece of garbagerepublicans never fail to entertain me with their hypocrisy and stupiditythis is just normal for the gop at this point i be worried if he proposed being against drag and hadnt already been in a drag show knowing how deep the mental latrine hole goes when dealing with right wingers is a good bit of datareport any and all sports related cross dressing to the police document it and pass it on to local and national media jocks fucking love to dress in drag make it count for them tooso to be a republican you need self loathing loathing anyone that does put money in your pocket zero conscience and projection projection i was raised as a republican and to hate gays and was pretty racist as well i moved out of my parents house at 16 and it took a long time to wash out my views of people i so glad i got out of that mindset looking in from the outside is super frustrating and it truly disappointing to think i used to blindly agree with some of their madnessoh but it s totally fine when i do conservativesy all really going crazy over me wearing a dress as a joke back in school for a theatre project yah that s not a sexually explicit drag lol y all will twist anything he wrote oh my godit seems like all gop men have a history of draggood god look at his mug he looks waaayyyyy gayer than even i dolol they really gave him a at the end what a complete shit show these hypocrites are trying to run speaks volumes of their voter baseso serious question has there ever ever been an politician whose kink did turn out to be the exact thing they were most vehemently opposingthe tooth to gum ratio is insanethe legislation hb 1266 seeks to amend texas business and commerce code to define a venue that hosts a drag performance and authorizes consumption of alcoholic beverages as a sexually oriented hooters anyone might not have a drag performance but certainly serves alcohol with a sexually oriented businesslmao it theatre when he does itthis dude has major gay facehis face just looks like it s been consensually dickslapped on a handful of occasion si can tell from the picture this guy is a fruitno one else gon na say it anyone alright this guy looks like an attractive gay dudeit s always projectionprojection appears to be the only consistent part of republicans platformhe s a danger to our children their logic also ever notice how a majority of etc are closetedthat s a closeted gay manhe looks like a robert crumb caricature of a compulsive masturbator high on acidits only ok if a disgraced lawyer dresses in drag and lets a future disgraced former president motorboat them https itd be a shame if this went viral and goes real life contentits a bit hypocritical to claim that wearing a dress in his instance for performance isn t sexual and is just for fun and then proposing a bill that prevents minors from attending lgbt performance events for their protection literally anyone could argue that theatre or women wearing dresses and having makeup on in any other event is indirectly sexual or is a hazard for minors thanthe party of projection fails to disappoint texas is nothing more than a political shit showhow is this the case like 100 of the time everytime i hear a republicans complain about they ve done it like they only know projectionand he chose that headshot closet much anyonethey all know there is nothing wrong with drag queens it is just a distraction like all republicans use they lie to you you vote for them because you believe them as they have absolutely no proof and are just making s up these are horrible people that should not be running our country in any shape or form another hypocrite republican equals hypocriteswhen are we going to have a national conversation about republicans this is healthy for the country the party is bigoted there no getting around it anymore you ca make excuses we should be pretending the church full of republicans are good people if you voting for republicans you voting for hate change my mindit never fucking fails if a conservative accuses someone of anything they are guilty of itthey hate themselves for who they are what a sad bunchit seems so bafflingly obvious that the people who believe that performing or wearing drag is inherently sexual are only but definitely engaging with drag in sexual contextsrules for thee but not for meea texas republican is a total hypocrite shocking teachers should be policemen because the actual policemen are pussies women are allowed to decide what happens inside their own bodies citizens of texas are paid to spy on other citizens of texas hmmmmm sounds familiar texas should be expelled from the usliterally every accusation is a confession lmaoconservatives do like their projectionso according to this bill ca play parts of the opposite gender insanityis anyone really surprised projection seems to be the driving factor behind extremism for at least a decade now in the usold enough to remember milton berle in drag what a great entertainerrules for thee not for mehuh it almost like projectionthese motherfuckers always projectingi m not shocked i tell you not shockedlook at the code switching between https and https in the closet ex youth pastor in congress from texas man could be more of a cliche if he enjoys getting dicked down wearing a blonde wig and heels while blasting dolly partonhistorically speaking that checks outrepressed religious fundamentalists typically want everyone else to suffer for their sinsthose who scream the loudest generally have the most to hideyeah i mean i not even shocked all i can say is that gop is a cesspool of people with and loathing i expect george santos to introduce a federal bill any day nowwhy does this dude look so greasy and wetthe projection is insaneguys how often do we have to repeat this it okay when conservatives do it the whole idea of culture wars is them vs us stop bothering with the details all you need to remember is them vs us as in ru paul in drag bad vs rudy guliani in drag goodit always the one you suspect the mostthey not anti drag they just do want anyone unexperienced to join their littel drag clubit a tale as old as timea gender identity that is different than the performer s gender assigned at no one is assigned a gender at birth gender and biological sex are different these fascists are so fucking stupidwhat so bad about drag queens why are all these men so offended by them it literally a parody of a woman an over the top cabaret act if anything it is the women who should be offendedwhy is it every time they try to something they are guilty of itthis stuff writes itselfthey do not care about being outed as hypocrites because their policies are not intended to enact a consistent theory of morality they want attention because attention can be converted directly into money and powerconservatives are such idiotsthe picture of the rep included in the story is giving me fucking nightmares he has some cheshire cat going on that is really messing with my mind right nowthe whole transphobic movement harps on how men should wear men clothes so to the republican moron politician who says that his wearing of a dress does constitute drag according to ben shapiro and a vast majority of your constituents it does be consistent in your values the more you get pissed off about it the more disingenuous we know you areevery accusation is a confession with conservativesit would really blow people minds if they found out how many people have had an abortion or encouraged someone else to have onethese demagoguing jerks promoting all the and book bills are the same hypocrites that are screaming about saving our first amendment rightsyah that s not a sexually explicit drag show but if this video had occurred in some other commercial enterprise it would fit the definition of a sexually oriented business from your bill 1 drag performance means a performance in which a performer exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer gender assigned at birth using clothing makeup or other physical markers and sings lip syncs dances or otherwise performs before an audience for entertainment 2 sexually oriented business means b a nightclub bar restaurant or other commercial enterprise that provides for an audience of two or more individuals a drag performanceit s always projection with the religous right whatever they re screaming loudest about they re secretly doing themselvesyes but this law is to apply to not some proper conservatives having a bit of fundude s a pastor he s definitely diddling kidsevery gop accusation is a confession every timedude everytime with these people this shit is just hystericalwhy are these always republicansevery accusation is a confessionrepublicans are perpetual hypocritesassuming it real i always wonder if these people have degradation and humiliaton fetishes and hope they get caughtwait is this a different person cause i think i read another one the other daydrag for me but not for thee it would seemthis is surprising a good portion of the texas legislature the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and state judges are a bunch of hypocritical assclowns just read the list of bills in the state legislature that have been proposed in the current session knowing a lot of them are projecting and self loathing is not surprisingrepublicans are so transparent whatever is they are upset about they are doing it bunch of perverts the whole republican lotthe ones that scream the loudest are usually the most guiltytypical hypocriteshow do they feel about powderpuff footballoh wow they being hypocrites i sure chud voters will change their vote this timeso what is this psychologically i did this thing and it was fun and nobody else deserves the same fun i did this thing and am ashamed and nobody else must have the chance to embarrass themselves in the same way i did this thing and am ashamed and must convince the world and myself that i in fact do not actually do the thingseems to be the themehe s making it illegal so he can feel dirtythe call is coming from inside the houseprojection it always projection they ca dress in drag they say

stretch his mouth to look like that what happeneddudes got more gum than juicy fruitmakes sense why drag is even on his mind in the first place i literally never think about drag unless someone else

thought this was an old story but it turns out this is another one the other shit head who was dressed in drag and wanting to ban drag shows is the governor of tncan t say he didn t try it before

a dna sample was retrieved from a lock broken at a subway gate and it matched evidence from a long island killing a year or so prior it finely emerged that 1 the sample had been compromised by a lab technician and there was no match and 2 new york city had a backlog of 500 untested dna samples from rape cases the city in an ows witch hunt had gone to the trouble and expense to pursue a minor breach over 500 felony cases the post never issued a retraction exposure however did force the city into dealing with the backlogthe long arm of the law and all i m glad they solved this case after

comes another toilet paper hoarding crisisif you are concerned about this pathogen then you should consider contacting whom ever is in charge of your local municipality tap water ask them if how many times in the last year has the local water supply been out of spec or exceeded the upper limit for coli contamination coli and shigella go hand in hand and are often due to an overuse of a water way by homeless people who use it as a source for bathing and as a toilet shigellosis is acquired from contact with contaminated feces coli contamination is checked typically on a routine monthly quarterly or semi annual basis per municipal reporting systems coli contaminations are also more likely to show up in the local news than say something like shigella or legionnaires disease but they all come from the same source also shiga toxin is almost identical to coli toxins in the gastrointestinal tract references https overview https for example my local water supply was out of spec 11 times in the last 5 years and recently our prison drinking water was contaminated with legionnaires httpswoohoo drug resistant bacteria here comes plague part 2 oh it only a stomach bug no sweet

same thing here in dallas dallas pd corralled a bunch of protesters onto a bridge then arrested and cited all of them for being on the bridge they also shot a bunch of randos who were even involved with the protests just people walking along minding their own businessone of the smartest things w did was have the republican convention at msg nyc for hisjust wonder after legal fees how much each

i witnessed the peaceful protests of some throwing things at the cops shouting threats to provoke a response and then record and cry foul those same cops are both human and have the same limits everyone else has i wonder how any of the protestors would feel if a cop threatened to kill them or spat at or on themall that money will be gone flushed down the toilets with drugs and parties and booze in about a monthguys i want the police to be directly impacted by their actions but if this money came our of their budget they would just escalate their use of civil asset forfeiture the public

setting up insulin productioncorporations works yeah nah this was more due to regulation in ca and from congress that one tweet certainly brought attention to the situation but this was in the works for a whilethis is huge good newsbut i was told doing this would destroy their ability to innovate and create new drugsit a good thing they did this but it is more likely with an aim to kill legislation and head off inquiries from the senate about profit margins in a few years with a republican president when republicans control both the house and the senate they could start increasing the price againtomorrow desantis will sign a bill to make it illegal to cap drug prices in floridacool but still fuck you t1 diabeticgood even while republicans are trying to revoke the 35 cap only for medicare they literally become worse than the rapacious companies they representonly after mandates have come from the current administration think about that for a moment remember kids companies will do as much as they can get away with to make money this is why we need regulations companies without regulations will rape and pillage and then state for the record they did nothing wrong because there were no rules against that behavior regulations dictate corporate behavior a company with no regulations does care about nor ethics they are there to make money full stopdeletedas a type 1 diabetic this helps relieves tiny bit of the stress that comes with this curseand they will still make bankrejoice now pump supplies do them next even in canada with no insurance i have paid almost for these supplies and the rest of them still crazy expensive for treatment luckily i have insurance now but being in uni and having to pay for health care items at that rate is insanecorrected title eli lilly forced to stop price gouging and cap insulin at 35 a monthreacting to legislation at least it s something root issue is patents sure some novel advancements to patents decades ago but they should be generic now that would lower costs to almost freepeople keep saying the market will fix it the market in the us at least has never in it history properly regulated itself it will always choose to screw over people in the pursuit of profits in cases like this it has ended with needless deathsremember they could have done this at any timebefore we get too excited they are capping the costs which means they are moving the costs from the pharmacy counter to the insurance premiums this will surely help some people but don t think that they are just capping the price of this stuffmy nasal spray went otc and now my insurance wo pay for it even though i had a prescription for 15 years it about 40 a month fuck us healthcarethanks to bernie sanders who initially pioneered the insulin concept and pushed it into the public discourse and kept it there for so many yearsjesus the contratianism in here is palpable this is a good thing could they have done it sooner yes could they lower it more yes but the best time for a good thing is always earlier the second best time is always today and that where we livedo give them an ounce of credit this is a political move the us healthcare system is insane they sold insulin for years at absurd prices and have just admitted they never had to they are doing this because a lot of people need insulin if they keep price gouging they are creating tens of millions of people who experience how rediculous the system is first hand by lowering the price on insulin they throw everyone a bone make themselves look good and stop people thinking about all the other drugs sold at absurd pricesso it could have been done at any time is what you telling me people have died because of insulin rationing i guess it a good thing to finally get here but we should be patting them on the back for finally ending price gouging and as others have said we only here because cali took the leadership on a national issue that both parties have been hemming and hawing onsounds from the article this is across the board too glad this seems to be finally fixedcareful they re heroesan interesting so that drug price caps don t overtake the industry let s take the profit loss here so we can continue to make obscene profits on our other serious sleight of hand stuff to get them out of the spotlightmake insulin it s original 7 dollars and i ll be happythis would not have happened without the passage of the inflation reduction act and ca setting up their own insulin production remember that when some dumbass tells you that voting does matter and are accomplishing anythingtoo late for my dead buddy 38 years old wife and kids fuck eli lillymoderna keeping vaccines free after bernie threatens to haul their ceo in front of congress eli lilly capping insulin at after a cap is introduced for medicare and ca is starting their own insulin production this shows that bullying works what other pharma companies can we bully into treating us fairlythe biden administration rattled themcan i get that for my cat his insulin is 200wow it s almost like the government can exert influence over pharmaceutical they just refuse to do itas much as i know this is because they care this still makes me a little happy for people like my mother who was paying nearly 500 a month at one point last yearthis is an example you can use if anyone ever asks you what democrats have done for us the pressure that california and the biden admin have put on eli lilly made this happen make no mistake that this will save the lives and livelihoods of millions of peoplenow they just have to make all the other medications that keep people alive actually affordable and they wo be completely fucking evildamn how manny ppl died just for us too finally get here ripthey could have done this at any fucking time how many diabetics had to die unable to pay for their medication before they decided to show some mercythe headline should read eli lily complies with new law reducing insulin to a congressionally set 35 per monthmonthly fee to stay alive is still madnessgreed is bringing us downno the headline is california legislation forces eli lilly to cap insulin at 35 for the whole country every time you see a headline like this make a mental note of the source and keep a running tab of their bias towards corporationsstill too much i think all of health care should be a businesswish this shit would have passed sooner could have saved my friends life fuck pharma and fuck every single higher up in the company hope y all sleep well knowing people s deaths are on your hands cowardsthank god with my private insurance through my work i just paid 800 for this months supply at the pharmacy yesterday i try not to complain too often since i know i m fortunate to have a job and a way to pay for it but this is a huge relief for me it s as much as my mortgage paymentcongratulations america the same price as any prescription in australiano they did not they capped the cost of insulin at 35 they will continue to charge insurers as much as they possibly can for the stuff try to remember whose money pays for insuranceoh wow fuck these guys with the rakey end of a rake forever stilli welcome this of course but what s their angle there must be something in it for themit welcome but they waited until we blew through our deductible for the yearevery day these little biden wins keep adding upyour reminder that every republican in congress voted against capping the price of insulin to 35 do not let republicans take credit for it capping the cost of insulin was all president biden democrats and we should be so proud of this huge accomplishmentit about god damn time when i was in my early years of uni i worked with a guy who required insulin guy barely made ends meet because so much of his monthly wages were already dedicated to insulin no one should be forced to live paycheck to paycheck just to acquire medication they need to survivemy 10 year old niece thanks youthose are amateur numbers bring that down to zerojesus these pharmas milking sick people is the lowest of the low of humanityreminder that they still getting about profit this is a step in the right direction but it a far cry from where it ought to be medicine should be sold at no more than double the cost it takes to deliver it to the consumer any company that takes government contracts or grants should be required to sell their medicine at a 10 profitwhen my daughter was a infant she had severe acid reflux they put her on otc nexium but it had to ground to powder form and we were charged 1k a month for it thank god we have insurance through my job her formula due to her milk allergies was 60 a can since she needed it due to medical issues we paid like 13 a can medication is so expensivelet s do epipens nextthat a good start but still needs to be lower big phamra has got to be hopping mad over this good ck emhow convenient after medicare just capped it at 35they are hedging their bets on mounjaro this drug has been called the most profitable drug potentially in history insulin is going to be a side hustleit s definitely a step in the right directionjust remember they could always have done this they chose grotesque profit over human lives until they were forced otherwise this is not a kindnesswhy stop there force big pharma to sell all of their drugs at a lower price for all americanssomehow someone in this thread is likely angry that they made insulin affordableprediction hypodermic needles and syringes will soon be 1000 eachno upvote from me until they give that shit away for free mostly just to compensate for the years of dick behavior towards the people who desperately need itthe cap automatically applies to people with private insurance people without insurance will be eligible as long as they sign up for eli lilly s copay assistance program as a pharmacy tech i ca stress this part enough please do go to the pharmacy expecting it to be 35 we have so many patients who do realize there are certain provisions qualifications etc regarding coverage on any medication they come in and get so angry to the point of yelling at us because i saw it on the news please do get frustrated with pharmacists and techs if they tell you it is 35 you need to do your part we already dreading things like otc covid tests not being covered anymore and having to explain that please do make it harder on your pharmacy workerspeople should tweet fantastical bullshit from fake company accounts more often it becomes true shortly afterjust to be clear 35 is still 50 more expensive than chile the country with the insulin cost between 6 and 10 is about the average for countries and this is before social security comes into playnow do asthma inhalersthis is amazing news but hopefully only the startwow so after a troll account on twitter made their stock shit the bed they see that being the good guys might bring good

hybrid war and plague 2 then we all need a global nap at this pointthailand and cambodia had report h5n1 cases last week and have a one 11 year girl death report it is bird to humanit about time for a new disaster i was getting boredi curious about this last week it was announced that the strain that affected the girl was native to cambodia as cambodia has experienced outbreaks in the past i was under the impression that the variant wreaking havoc worldwide is different than the native variant so if true my question becomes did the cambodian variant undergo similar mutations or is there an error somewhere in the grand scheme it really does matter it not the last we have heard from h5n1 it on full blown pandemic watch a pandemic is not imminent but conditions are favorable for them to spawn like a good ol tornado watch in the uschina just reported human bird flu about 30 mins ago httpswhat about second pandemic what a timeline we in mani hope someone is working on an mrna vaccine

cambodia and not wherever the racist viral emu lesbian bird farm fraud is livingi will never wear a masknanwhere i play hockey there is a men league where anyone can play we have women on our team and then there a women league that is only for women who ca hack it in the men league this has worked just fine for the last 30 years that i been playingsports is a misnomer as more often than not these teams are open to anyone of any sex women sports on the other hand were created so that sports were more inclusive of and fair for women i do know the right answer to all of this but i believe there a way to be more inclusive of trans people without harming the inclusiveness and fairness of women sportsremovedthat s fair i don t play street hockey with children to fit in i play to wipe the pavement with those little bratsgirls sports is discriminatory it must be because it the entire reason for the existence of girls sports it is fair that anyone who wants to play in girls sports ca do so by design and by necessityremovedremoveddid the players choose to forfeit or just the adults in chargethis is pretty much the single thing i ca agree with the left on i do understand how it makes sense to compromise fairness for all women in sports to accommodate the comparatively tiny amount of trans women i think the team made a respectable decision by sticking to their principlesremovedit important for people to recognize that this is largely an issue manufactured to divide us there are vanishingly few trans people participating in high school sport yet these few players receive an inordinate amount of attention because it generates outrage and gets clicks further it is used to make the broader point that liberals are out of touch and do understand biology this is not so hrt changes a person biology and this has carryover effects on athletic performance still most studies do show some retained strength and athletic advantages in trans women after hrt though these studies were largely conducted on individuals that started hormone therapy later in life ie after initially undergoing male puberty however this does not mean that every trans woman is going to cis women at the level of high school sport we probably need to have a conversation about inclusion vs overall fairness statistically most trans women are not going to automatically be the standout athlete dominating their sport we just see the cases that are pushed into headlines and here the study that i referencing on this https https edit lotta people missing the point here and there are probably ways to balance inclusion and fairness some ultra running events have tried to balance this by keeping events open but possibly excluding advantaged athletes at the podium levelwe withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players fogg said in a statement i have to agree with them it just doesn t seem fair to have a biologically male athlete compete in a female sporti swear i ve heard like 8 people at the bar bitching about trans athletes but only 1 or 2 people bitching about cost of living inflation and one of those was me this is such a tiny inconsequential issue in the long run but it s being propped up to distract us from the things that actually affect all of usremovedthe comments in here make it seem like the transgender player was scoring 100 points a game while punching and bodyslamming the other teamit s really funny how reddit has really strong feelings about girls high school basketball but only on this one issuei m a liberal and i believe that bio men should not be allowed to compete in women s sportsa lot of you never played sports in high school and it definitely shows if you think it is even remotely fair for mtf athletes to be competing against cis women than you are just willfully ignorant you are abolishing the accomplishments made by cis women they have fine tuned their bodies to do insane things and it is not fair to have a biological advantage over those people i am a male and if ftm men were stronger than the average cis male i would be saying the exact same thing people are cherry picking and saying a lot of transgendered athletes are a lot stronger than the average male yes an athlete is stronger than the average person irregardless of gender and sex they work out a lot more simple if you took the average cis woman athlete compared them to the average trans mtf athlete i guarantee every strength competition would be won by the trans personremovedeveryone complains when its mtf trying to participate but nobody forcing ftm to play in women sports why is thatdepending on the sport and the context a trans athlete can have advantages over cis athletes an example would be rubgy where this has been an ongoing issue for a while some extreme cases show a startling difference in build which begs the question wtf do we do https it would be good to get some context for this story are we talking about a christian school refusing to play simply because or is this indeed a case where safety is an issueremovedi really doubt that the people in this comment section who are outraged about a transgender person competing actually care at all about girls sportsremovedwe need fairness and we need inclusion we smart let figure it outi am not transphobic let me make that clear i just do not think it s fair for the girls to play against an obvious disadvantage when it comes to strength and height in a sport where that is a big advantagehow would you feel if lebron was dunking on your daughter it ruins the integrity of the game i m convinced the people who call this bigotry have never watched team sports in their lifetrans people are real and require support but biological sex is a real phenomenon some trans people require universal participation in the idea that their true gender is an immutable characteristic when this participation is lacking the result is that some people think it is acceptable to go to war it is not okay to lash out at people like rowling who simply prioritize what they feel is important according to their values in her case women rights even if one does agree it is easy to understand that position people like her are not at least not knowingly all that they want is that when biological women rights come into direct conflict with trans women rights that biological women have higher priority if one is forced to choose that is exactly what this basketball team case is about it is truly uncaring to disregard their position trans women will never be exactly the same as biological women it is better to accept this that does say anything negative people might think it says it does mean hrt and other measures are worth it or are not i do understand why people to be normal what is wrong with not being exactly the same people who think this way are just young and inexperienced learn to mature and gradually accept your differencesit going to be a religious school is it mid vermont christian school was set to play long trail school on february 21 but mvcs forfeited the game due to a transgender player on long trail s roster yup called itusing children to fight these fights is kind of disgusting but that where we areso they just took the loss and gave the team with the transgender athlete a free win in the tournament wow they sure showed themfairness in sport should be judge based on how well an individual performs but rather how well they would performed otherwise put these trans women in the male division with the other males and the majority would even qualify to competethe alliance defending freedom has a lawsuit the 2nd circuit court of appeals revived en banc over this issue and conservative groups are going full hysteria about this personally considering transgender people are such a small minority of the population this issue is on the bottom of political issues worth caring aboutwould have expected to play even if you challenged the results or rules surrounding the events after all wouldn t you still utilize the opportunity as a and a coaching opportunitysome high school kids had to play against shaq and lebron sports are unfairremoveda private christian school refused to play against a team with a biological male mid vermont christian school we withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our playersremovedremovedi hope every team in the country does the samethe only fair game is all genders and all hormone intake then there will be no argumentsi all for trans inclusion trans girls clearly have a huge edge over cis girls they are hurting other trans people by playing versus cis girls edit people down voting because they hate women sadremovedremovedi wonder if the girls had any say in the matter every athlete i spoken to does seem to give a crap about this issue how is a sport more important than making a person feel safe and respected i put money that the administrators made this decision for the team and are making the athletes suffer for other people prejudicesis it really so bad to risk losing a high school match so much at stake well they lost anyway a forfeit is agreeing to a loss but now the players never got a chance to play i feel bad for their players i bet this was a decision made by their managementi coach a women sport that has transgender athletes in it it not as big of an advantage as you think it is edit i see the bigot parade has gotten in hereit s hilarious how much people care about high school sports as soon as a trans person is involved fucking bigots don t give a fuck about high school sports just trying to bash some childidk as a former female athlete i would care as a glorious amazon standing at 6ft and 185 of muscle and bone do you think i did compete against tiny lil chicks with bird bones who weighed 90 lbs soaking wet i say they whipped my ass 50 of the time those gals can flit like beautiful hummingbirds it amazing i would have relished the competition frankly if they were as powerful and strong as a male and i beat them i be feeling fucking legend says a lot more about how confident these girls are about their skill set more than likely someone who has absolutely zero knowledge of biology is telling them they ca do it real athletes would say bring it on that the game you want to be a ftm playing on the men team get out there and hustle hang with the boys not that they let you mtf playing on the opposing team beat the fuck out of that team and then do your victory laps this is just more division and gate keeping as usual get in your box assholes i rather die than let a bunch of boring ass inflexible people dictate my hobbies for me or anything in my life than they already do like the box i do evolve adapt thrivegood they working toward that goal of keeping religion out of sports tournamentslooks like the school is doing a fundraising campaign got ta get those performative bigotry dollarsi understand the frustration but forfeiting only hurts themselves worst that could happened is they lose it high school no one is getting paid play the gamesince when were sports fair i got kicked off a coed recreational softball team because i wasn t good enough for them the basketball players weren t even willing to try so just took their ball and went home maybe their team isn t that goodgiving the other team a free win to own the libshell of a life lesson when you faced with a challenge the best thing you can do is quit great coaching clearlyit s very clear that almost everyone in these comments has never even met a trans women lolremovedjust want to comment before the thread is lockedif a player was born with a penis it isnt woman in the competitive sports arenaisn t this just common senseyou can t even say this is about fairness because there simply isn t that kind of parity in high school basketball to begin with lisa leslie a ciswoman once scored 101 points in a half in high school basketball this is purely about bigotrywe withdrew from the tournament because we believe playing against an opponent with a biological male jeopardizes the fairness of the game and the safety of our players fogg said in a statement yeah how dare they expose their kids to things outside of their bubble how else will they grow up with all that hatei inclined to say that this is up to the players if they want to forfeit for this reason they should otherwise if they cool with it play on as for the other aspects of the argument i think when someone transitions has implications as to whether or not it a fair play in sports as well as what sport i knows some trans women who transitioned as an adult who clearly would have an advantage i known some that really do seem like they would have an advantage so perhaps this should be looked at on an individual basis rather than blanket bans i aware this thread is about kids i not informed enough to make an argument for or against itreminds me of the end of segregation and all those schools refused to play against integrated teamssurprised this was in vermont but not that it was a school christians like to carry around quote the bible but rarely follow its teachings love thy neighbor yeah right like the down votes bet atheists are responsible johnas a man who has never watched a girls basketball game i feel my opinion on this topic is completely irrelevant and should be ignored along with those of everybody like metime for people to pretend to be brave by posting some of the most transphobic shit ever and get tons of upvotes even though they don t understand science or how hormones work at all but whateverbruh can reddit not be transphobic for like 1 seconda christian school for contextnothing brings out the masquerading bigots on reddit like hating on trans people if you ever started a post with the following i support but that does need your kind of supportimagine your a player looking back in 20 years and realizing you lost your last game by forfeit because you refused to play because of 1 player if you think you will lose because of that player and choose to forfeit because of that reason you lost either waywhy are you all assuming this person has had a male puberty nothing in the article says so and many trans kids are on blockersmid vermont christian school why am i not surprisedthis is no different than teams not playing against teams with black players in jim crowa girl in my high school was such a good shooter she played on the men basketball team i went against her in practice many times and she was probably the second best overall guard we hadlol love all the fake i m as left as they come comments my only question would be gas she finished transitioning if so what is the issue is she expected to compete against men nowand kids let this be a lesson to you these people will give up their integrity their intelligence their dignity all because an idiot tells them to do so you do want to be around or play with people like this let them go back home and play in the mudremovedremovedremoveddeletednansays the guy that bombs schools and hospitalsthe old russian paradox in action we are so strong and the world should respect us through fear and awe 50 people attacked russia and we are a victim who needs simpathy well which one fucking is it russiain russia when enemy fight back he is terroristeither a false flag or if it is genuine they brought it on themselves they deserve what they getrussia realizes it stuck its dick in a beehivezoh they bombed themselves did they good goodi would believe russia if they said it was raining i checksign of a desperate country we all remember chechnyaone country terrorist attack is another country defense against an illegal invasionrussia is pathetic and delusional they must be defeatedrussia truly the most innocent of military powers why do these awful random events keep happening to them when they done nothingis putin using agents to blow up a bunch of apartments againand reuters repeats that statement with a straight face how comicalyou mean freedom fighters get rekt ruzziarussia tries to deny civil war movement fixed titleway too much vodka and delusionswhat a bunch of crybabiesi do believe this for a second of course the same can be said for every statement coming from russia here is how you can tell if russia is lying they speakingeven if ukraine did so what mariupol would like a word it is kind of a side effect when you go to war with another country if you reduce their cities to rubble you should expect that there is a good chance one of your cities may be reduced to rubblea war you vodka swilling schlups you being attacked because you in a war i call them a bunch of mongoloids but the mongols are a fine upstanding lot compared to these mooksfighting as terrorists i think something was lost in translationrussia says lots of things sometimes they even truethey literally declared war a year ago the first time it touches home help save us from terrorist i know it them creating a situation almost surely themselves but why its does even make sense the country we invading and committed war crimes against is fighting back help save us from the terrorists to the whole outside world this is a jokei wonder if there is a way to donate to freedom fighter groups inside russiadid they turn their guns aroundany counterattack inside russian territory is more than well deservedif you attacking ukraine the sites you launch those attacks from are fair game as well as the infrastructure you need to support the invasion a few small groups could do a lot of damage in russia without the bad press of bombing civilians if nothing else having to commit resources to tracking them down means those resources are being used to invade ukrainei mean the us goes half way across the world to bomb weddings because terrorism yet they can t explain how those people are going to make it to the mainlandnanyeah some fbi agent was probably hanging out in the same discord server for racists againapparently the fbi really needs to improve its goddamn radarso are a million other issuespinging

there was some sort of pattern we could recognize https https https https https https https https https httpsmain thing is he got to use his second amendment rights that right exceeds the right to get through life without being shot dead in americananthis crash was entirely preventable but due to negligence of the greek government this happened prime minister mitsotakis is very quick to claim that it was human error that caused the crash but in fact it was due to their outdated railway system this is what occurs when governments don t invest in infrastructure and pocket money this was preventable and 80 of the deaths were young students very tragicnanlol this article theres 3 wounded cops a dead guy a woman in custody and somehow nobody fucking knows or is saying who shot anybody ok keystone kopswell what were they wearingpolice and identified i think we all know what that meanshow many months of paid leave should the shooter getthe cops might ve been resisting too much maybe reaching for something of course the other person was fearing for their lifewas the shooter in fear for their lifei holding on any until i see video evidenceremoveddid the officers have a history of domestic abuse did they reach for their guns did they comply with all legal questions from the residents it sounds an awful lot like they brought this upon themselves but i guess we should jump to conclusions until we have all the evidence edit oh they may have just shot each other in a panic and that kind of hilarious probably not but the way it worded it leaves that option open and now it mythis is the official police story take it as you willeither the cops shot each other or the gunman is john wick able to take out 3 cops by himself and get awayi fully expect it to turn out that all of their injuries were self inflictedlove how they won t say who fired the shots that hit the officers when basic forensics could tell you that pretty quickly probably friendly fire in some capacity also search warrants while people are at home are dumb literally the most likely place for them to have lots of guns available lolthe cops probably shot each other and will pin it on the ladythe article is written entirely from the perspective of the police which would be fine if this was the police union daily but it cnn a media outlet that supposed to hold the powerful accountable woman in custody after hourslong standoff that followed the shooting of three officers authorities say starting with the headline no mention of the dead man found inside the home a deceased man was also found in the home according to state authorities who killed him meh we do know and cnn does care authorities have not said who fired the shots that injured the officers who shot the cops we do know we ve been reminded too much lately in kansas city how dangerous police work can be he said i am praying for a full recovery for our three officers injured this evening and that everyone on duty gets home to their families true but the leading cause of death for cops lately has been covid not shootings police work is dangerous no doubt but it just seems like they go out of their own way to make it sound like they going to war every day meanwhile the job of delivery driver is more dangerous cops are not even in the top 10 https httpsremovedi would take the entire article and anything that kcpd puts out as a massive pile of salt these fucks have a terrible history of terrorizing this city with impunity because they answer to the gop run state only unless something has to do with drugs or tracking down a murderer they wo even come take a statement it would surprise me one bit that they did have a warrant eitheroh my god i can get two pairs of slacks for 12 at target3 people shot and 1 additional person dead and this article has the clarity of mudyou would think they would release bodycam footage right away if it didn t implicate the cops of wrongdoing and the raid was justified and executed legallythe reducing gun restrictions seems to be working as expected in americai m not sure if this is bad news or good newsthat s a shame prayers and whatnotsomeone was fearing for their lifeso she feared for her lifejust cops no real peoplehang on this can not be possible not only were the police officers good guys with guns they are trained in gun use and handling these situations does this mean the nras good guy with a gun line is bullshiti feel like there s a positive feedback loop of fear that s been going on and will get worse between police and civilianswonder if this is the same form search warrant that was invalidated for the state of missouri years ago but they keep usingalso a cop in chicago was shot and killed today httpswell i guess they will be going back to no knock warrantsnanyeah well what the fuck do you expect rates are enormous but prices won t budge because no one is sellingi got a call from my mortgage company trying to tell me how great it could be and all the cash i could get out of my house by refinancing now lol i m at i laughed them right off the phonei m lucky in that i bought a house nearly 6 years ago i make 33k more now but wouldn t be able to afford my house if i had to buy it todaythat what happens when mortgage rates are inflated home prices are inflated and real wages have been flat as fuck for my mortage rate is if i bought the exact same house today at the same price my payment would be about a 180 higher and unaffordable for us only 6y lateralso all cash sales are higher than they have been in years foreign and domestic investors are readily creating cash flow for themselves into perpetuity the rest of america will be slaves and kept pooruh m single no debt and i can t afford a house at the current prices and mortgage ratesit is the year 2050 houses are now mill average interest has finally dropped minimum wage increased to 17usdi just have to wait until someone dies so i can inherit a house and hope nothing goes wrong in the meantimeprices haven t dropped but the monthly payments have gone up substantially you re literally paying more for the same so why would you take out a mortgage if you can wait i also feel bad for all of the mortgage officers working on refis too no one in their right mind would ever refi nowcan t believe i m seeing the payments some people are 600 mortgages i thought a monthly payment like that for literally anything was impossible nowadays but several people are living it and in owned houses too not apartments side note at 995 for a 2bd apartment about to be at 1100 minimum when i renew my lease this may if i try to move everything else jumps to a monthlate to the post what can a company offer to get someone to move from a house mortgage to this environmentthat s what happens when the fed plays games they lent money at zero interest for over a decade and now they want to fix it in 8 months it s economic terrorismoh you mean people ca afford million dollar homes that our parents bought for 50kfuckin where because not in my market everything is selling overnight still and i am getting outbid on every offeri in la where you can expect to pay 1 million to own anything yet the average salary is like 70k literally no one can afford a mortgageton of home buyers got locked in at really cheap rates higher rates will lead to a cool off period the housing market is cyclical prices will temper down with the rate takes about a yearyea because no one can afford a house anymore a lot of people are just worried about how they are going to make it to the next month the american dream is deadmultinational corporations are still buying homes left and right using the trillion donald trump gave them that why prices have gone down substantiallya new neighborhood near me is near sold out most likely by two income families making just enough and i ca buy because i only have a single income and rates are too high literally i can afford the price but rates have made the payment surpass the acceptable dti for my income i just want the smallest new house and everything else is years old and rotten and is literally selling for the same price as this new housing these rate increases are only punishing the middle class and poor the 1 can pay cash and wait it out we cathere is a reason why only new homes are being soldi do understand why we allow foreign interests and hedge funds to buy properties in bulk their should be a tiered tax bracket based on how many homes you own exceeding 1 then an additional tax if you own a home outside of the state of your primary their is any reason a working family should be able to afford a home comfortablyinterest rates yo whitewell the government jacked up the interest rates to cool off spending this was to be expectedhouse prices are ridiculous and with the small interest rates creeping toward 10 who can afford that toxic comboimagine that who could have seen this comingi can t manage to save up a down payment for my first home because rent car payments prescriptions and food use up all of my pay i ve finally worked my way up to earning 60k just 9 years after graduating from law school and i can barely get bywell since the only mortgage i can afford is the burned out meth housethis must be why my mortgage company emails me every single day begging me to refinanceit is absolutely insane what home prices are now most of millennials and gen z can only dream about becoming homeownersi applied for a mortgage a few months as a first time buyer and was denied because i took two weeks off between jobs and that was consider unreliable okay so i need to work every day of my life just to own a house i guessi would love to buy a house my credit is good my dti is nominal my partner and i could easily afford a mortgage 20 years ago it s like they dangle the carrot and you know how the rest goesit dropped because corporations do not need bank money to buy properties someone pls fix thisi was able to get my mortgage company will call and email periodically and say they have some ways that they can improve my mortgage improve it for whoyeah insane housing prices and higher rates will do thathomeowners aren t buying houses are basically big money is treating the housing market like investors historically treated long term safe way to hedge against inflation the buyers don t need mortgages because they are not workers earning a wage the buyers have billions they need to stuff somewhere the us has done nothing about it there should be a total cost of value tax on any owner of residential property that isn t the primary resident we shouldn t be living in a world where businesses buy houses in cash but people who want a home for their family can t get an offer together fast enoughi do qualify for a 800 monthly mortgage so instead i pay 1100 a month for rent this system is so brokeni purchased a home this week at 30 year fixed higher interest rate but the home didn t go into an insane bidding war and sell for 400k over asking like it would have in 2021 sofrom july 22 i recognize that i got in right before it went stupidi hope that the entire housing market crashes and burns along with all of these investors so they go bankruptthe issue as i see it is this 5 years ago i paid 300k for my house my mortgage bill is 1000 a month i could sling pizzas for a living and pay that my current home valuation is 700k how in the ever living hell is someone supposed to afford that i couldn t afford to buy it and i make almost 200k a year i feel so bad for the younger generations the only way they will ever own a home is if they have a career that pays them absurd amounts of money or they wait for their parents to die and inherit the home it s absolutely disgustingthat dude isn t leaning far back enough southparki make great money and have zero debt i can afford a prepandemic house no problemo current prices for a place that s not a shit hole i m not paying those i ll keep on renting with my fantastic roommateit aint over yet gravy trainersi d love to move put of my 1928 but even though i can sell it for a ridiculous amount i can t find anything in 50 miles that s the price i d get it would be a shittier shoebox i d end up having to buy at 2x the price the interest if not more i m going to let this crumble around me before i moveso i in an awesome position to be saving up to buy in the next yearslow interest rates locked in why on earth would anyone trade a low rate loan for a much higher one it only make sense if you have to move and are downsizing supply will tighten property values will go up and at some point the equity will get to enticing to leave there and people may start selling againimma need a mortgage to pay renti bought a house for 60k down plus a 30k loan but this was almost 20 years ago i paid my loan off in like 4 years this could never happen in todays market my house is now worth 300k now which is bafflingi stopped looking maybe i could afford something when rates were low but now i ca even with high rates i ca count on them going lower i renewed my lease and i count myself lucky it not a bad apartment and there are people who live closer to the city paying hundreds more pet month than i do so i have less to worry about for a yearwhich is weird at least here in the northeast where buying a home is far more economical at this point than rentinga lot of hoomers are talking about low supply ad nauseum but they forget it called the law of supply and demand it does matter how low supply is if demand is lower prices will drop the same applies to the opposite extreme as well high supply higher demand prices still go up just looking at the supply side of things only gives you half of the picture and i would say its the less important halfi just hope all the people that bought more than one home get fucked if it s your only home then i hope you re good we all deserve a homeplease please let there be a catastrophic housing collapse so i may one day own a house before i diejust glad i sold when i sold and bought when i did last year because i in a pretty solid situation consideringbuying a house currently is basically just renting from the bank work til ya dieyeah rates are super high right now relative to recent history but that probably an ok thing in the long run at a certain point the only way home prices are going to drop is if demand is reduced enough plus it not like it impossible to buy a home if you actually have the money and a motivated sellerlet these people who got under stay stuck i will wait and buy a brand new build and it will be what i want they may not move by choice but it s not like we stopped buildingduh investment companies bought nearly all of the available houses in our state unless you own land and go with a new build you re going to be rentingso has inventory of homesmy makes six figures in ohio and even he ca get a fucking house lolso why not just drop the interest rates so folks can buy homesi think it odd that people have put off large expenses like buying a home due to rising interest rates but the government wants to raise the debt ceiling regardless what the interest is that has to be paid does the government worry about paying higher and higher interest rates on the national debtan effect referred to as no shiti pass a glorious sign every day on my way to work for a mortgage company with the motto we dare you to compare sporting a fashionable with points withoutnanabusers stall abuse reporting boy scouts catholic church etcwhat are they afraid of the idea that clergy should have any immunity is antiquated at besthi welcome to mormon run utah we like to hide things here alcohol behind called zion curtain so the kids do see people consuming it abuse that occurs in mormon that church leaders become aware of but want to keep hidden meetings between government officials who are mormon and church leaders where the church will is made known in how mormon politicians are supposed to vote and act in the church interests extends outside of utah as well we even hide masonic rituals in our temple that show the secret handshakes secret names and passwords that all mankind is required to learn by becoming mormon that one will be required to give the sentinel angels in order to gain access to the highest heaven and become exalted like godit never ceases to amaze me how common it is for people to blindly protect and defend monsters simply because they are in a special group whether it religious organizations or athletics or social clubs or whatever there are always enough people willing to do absolutely anything to help others cover it up at this point i feel like there must be something wrong with how my brain is wired i would even cover for a sibling if they did those things why the hell would i cover for a college football coach or a pastorformer mormon here if you want the mormon church to change it ways all it requires is pressure and shaming from the outside that the tldr right there you can stop reading now to go respectfully tell a mormon that you disapprove of the way their church protects pedophiles from the law it has worked before and it will continue to work just look at the examples of polygamy racism and homophobia mormons were very invested in their polygamy including making it a requirement for salvation maximum salvation that is mormons have a salvation model when the world told them to stop they said no but when the us government threatened to seize their temples god saw fit to reveal commandments that outlawed the practice boom reformed mormons believed that black people were less loyal to god than white people in the war in heaven before we were born for that reason they were allowed full membership in the church for most of it nearly existence in 1979 roughly 10 years after the civil rights movement god finally revealed that the ban should be lifted modern mormons have no explanation for why the ban was imposed in the first place but it was definitely god not racist men and no explanation for why it took so long to be lifted but they so happy about it and it was a wonderful blessing from the lord note it was a total coincidence that the rest of the world had been pressuring the church to integrate for years boom reformed mormons have always believed that homosexuality is a sin but the contrast in the way the church approached the issue a few years ago and the way they handle it today is extremely telling in the past the church openly instructed it members to vote for legislation and they flatly condemned homosexuality as a sin today about 15 years and 1 lost culture war later the church loves and embraces members who experience attraction and they backed a recent bill protecting gay marriage they went from condemnations to justifications in just a few short year they in full retreat on this issue and 10 years from now they going to be pretending that they never even cared about sexual orientation in the first place boom since it inception the church has been fleeing it reputation as a fundamentalist cult they want to live their beliefs but they very much care what others think of them they stick to their regressive guns as long as they can to help maintain the pretense that the teachings of the church are constant and unchanging but eventually the pressure builds to the point where god finally comes along to reveal that the church persecutors are actually correct in their condemnation and so they reluctantly reform and rewrite history to reflect that they were always doing the right thing it not getting as much attention as i wish it would but the church was recently investigated by the sec and it was revealed that they been committing tax fraud for decades hiding billions of dollars behind a wall of shell companies they collect 10 of their members personal income as tithing and then use those sacred funds to make literal billions on the stock market mormonism is a business tithing is their revenue stream and cult shit does sell mormons want you talking about how nice and happy they are because that good marketing being widely condemned for shielding pedophiles and rapists from the law is bad for business as a final note you should know that the church has no internal reform mechanisms no suggestion box no opportunity to submit feedback they led by a prophet who supposedly speaks to god so members opinions are not welcome how are you supposed to argue with god right the only thing that moves these geriatric sociopaths is the external existential threat of being seen for what they really currently are by the outside world they love it when you make jokes about having lots of wives because there has been polygamy in the mainstream church for a long time and it easy to spin that into persecution it actually helps them keep their flock under control but asking hard questions that ca be away that fatal like how is it ok for a prophet of god to lie about billions of dollars hiding it from the government and his own followers how is it ok for a mormon bishop to know that a member of his ward is regularly raping his daughter and not report it to the authorities why does the church maintain a colossal dragon horde of money instead of using it to help the less fortunate this is 10x longer than i meant for it to be but it cheaper than therapy so i not going to edit it down to a normal length sue medespite initial momentum religious groups in several states have blocked those efforts doubling down on lobbying tactics they ve used for years to defend exemptions it never ceases to amaze me how much money religious groups spend on protecting child molesterswhen will americans no longer tolerate religion and it abusersthis is not a surprise at all their leaders at all levels cover up abuse all the time all the timestill makes my brain melt that we have an entire state ran by a church and everyone is just cool with that a church that has off shore accounts fake companies doesn t pay taxes and abuses the hell out of its members and kills those that threaten it the usa is a huge gangland hangout where the scum rulei think they have first amendment rights and religious protections utah senate president stuart adams a saint himself said noting fears among religious leaders that clergy could be punished for breaking vows of confidentiality legislation that would require a priest to report sexual abuse violates our right to practice our religion bishop oscar solis of the salt lake city catholic diocese wrote in a 25 letter to parishioners in the wake of the ap s investigation last year republican state phil lyman and democratic angela romero announced plans to reform utah s privilege loophole lyman who served six years as a saints bishop said at the time lawmakers should want to reexamine the loophole regardless of religious or political people should be able to go and confess their sins to their bishop without fear of being prosecuted up until when they are confessing something that has affected someone s else life significantly he told the ap in august lyman ultimately released a proposal that broadly affirmed clergy s exemption from mandatory reporting and they wonder why young people are leaving the church in droves that quote from the catholic bishop is especially abhorrent basically saying we have a religious right to cover up and choose not to report abuse if your religious obligations impel you to ignore or cover up abuse you need to rethink why you a part of that religious organizationca remember the last time i was abused at a drag queen story hourclergy still prioritizing fear of excommunication over outing sexual predators in their ranks stalling only suggests you re complicit that s just the culture of the faithchildren should just kill their abusers it s the only way they ll ever get true justice in americathis should enlighten you to the extent of the abusereligious leaders yeah we don t want to incriminate ourselves by reporting sexual we aren t going to pay taxes either so don t askall these churches regardless of religion should be paying their fair share of taxes things like this is common sense to normal people but not to these pedophilesthis is how you know the conservatives insistence on protecting children is all bullshit if they actually gave a shit churches would be a safe haven for children instead the clergy fear reporting child abuse within its ranks because it is so rampant it would threaten the foundation of their institutionsabusers are going to support other abusers religion is toxici just going to say it even by the fantastical standards of religion the entire genesis and backstory behind mormonism is absolutely laughableour religion is special we can abuse children and we do have to tell anybodyremovedi m actually curious what the law makers reasoning behind this is for sure on the outside it would appear they wish to protect perpetrators but what is the actual reason is it that is it separation of church and state is it a belief that they can do more help if they don t have to report it i highly doubt the reason is simply they love to abuse and want to talk about itput simply if your religious beliefs require you to conceal abuse then your religion is abusivei m a former mormon one of the steps in repentance was making restitution for sin to those we harm if you sexually abuse someone shouldn t going to jail be part of paying restitution yet in a lot of cases bishops help the male member avoid that very thing all the while the victim is left without support there s no jesus in a church like thatstalled in a republican legislature while republicans claim to want to protect kidsmaybe the worst part is that this is something that survivors experience often and unfortunately it s rare when their stories are heard she said we kind of know that abuse is widespread in a lot of religious settings but it true that it is silenced very oftencrazy to think that reporting a crime is controversial with a group that claims to be the moral way to liveadams a saint himself said noting fears among religious leaders that clergy could be punished for breaking vows of confidentiality if you are a priest and you report child abuse to the police and your superiors in your heirarchy punish you for that i be hard pressed to imagine a clearer sign that you chose the wrong religion as signs go that right up there with a burning bush or something with 100 eyes screaming at you to not piss your pants in terrorthe most dangerous place for children is churches not drag showsbut but but republicans said drag shows were the problemso do the mormons on reddit here turn a blind eye to the abuse and as well or does that only happen over in utahwhat are abuse stalls sounds creepysurvivors of abuse yet again feel unheardwhat is the fucking excuse for not doing this i feel like anybody who advocates against reporting should be put on a listcowards rapist supporting cowards ca do what right for the people because their too busy doing favors for those who hide rapists in their ranks f cking cowardsthe child victims are going to need better lobbyists to compete against a churchof course because people we re supposed to trust deeply to be moral bastions of society don t want to report abuse of minors what the fuck yet another reason to walk away from churches they honestly think this stuff is how many times have we heard this story in the past decades far far too manyoh weird who could have guessedthis shouldn t even be acceptable for debate abuse needs to be reported period the fact that this is happening shows how corrupt it all isutah bravely saying we want our pedophiles right here with our kids thank you very if this same article was about the middle east and muslims they d lambaste the whole situation constantly how could they let so and so do such things to their childrenthis just another of example that highlights how rampant the abuse is in the church they know that if this law passes the extent of the abuse would become known and taint the church additionally the abuse is so rampant in the church that they need a hotline staffed by attorneys 24 hours a day 7 days a week for the leaders not victims to call it is shameful they work so hard to protect the abusers and not the victimswhat more important 1 protecting a child rapist who confessed to that rape 2 protecting the child who was the victim for utah republicans and other church goers the answer is number 1i am jack s complete lack of surprisethe zealots keep feeding their children to the church these priests prey on them for their own gratification why do parents knowingly do thatgod specifically says to stop lying and admit truth it s probably not working in utah because they don t actually believe in god they believe in money power connections but not god you don t hoard billions of dollars of wealth if you believe in god actions speak louder than wordsthe mormon church not wanting to report abuse that so surprisingto be fair abuse invented the mormons asking them to stop is like asking santa to cancel christmaswildly corrupt and evil mormon utahreally says something about a religion when it religious leaders think it better and more morally righteous in their gods eye to ignore child abuse and stay in the church than it is it save a child and be excommunicated i mean really does that very simple fact say everything that needs to be said about these big religions and their leadersthe problem is that abused kids do donate money to state lawmakers hence the state law exemptions about clergy reporting edit missed the do clarification there pretty big missi m curious what if any pushback there is for thiswhy are these religions so terrified of mandatory reporting of sexual abuse catholics mormons baptist s doesn t matter they all turn to litigation to protect their lies and liabilitythen they re all guiltywould it go against a religion to help protect abusers particularly if they are clergystahp making us make ourselves look baddlikely letting the idea soak a bit firsti mean how would this solve anything like the abusers just wo confess anymore simple as that at least the clergy could send an anonymous tip in the first casecriminals abusers and child molesters over protecting children and women utah you have your priorities straightmen have long used the cover of religion for their abuses of all kindshow else will they find a wifeat least it not the wrong sort of people abusing our kidswe investigated ourselves and found no incidents of improprietywhat most of the research shows is that if people aren t able to come to them for fear of being reported on they re not able to provide the help and support they need ann milner said jusus christ i ca believe these people say this stuff with straight faceyes but the drag shows and trans athletes are the real problemif you think your religion requires in any way and to any extent the covering up of child abuse that should be sign number one that your religion is trash and should be abandonedutah is a state run by death cultistsis anyone the least bit fucking surprisedthis is one of the few times that it okay to accuse anyone who is against this of either being a pedophile or being an advocate for pedophiliawhen is this country going to change the laws for not for profit charitable organizations and religious organizations the lack of oversight lack of taxation is actually undermining the very society as a whole hospitals bankrupt patients cover up poor and negligent care treat employees like strangers on and on religions build their churches by dozens in small towns then pay no property tax say they are helping the poor who starve right outside their doors and rape our children in the name of god religion pushing political agendas it s a cancerlol of course it does the very basis of the mormon religion is abusiveremovedi agree the mandatory reporting exemption for pastors should be removed but the argument is obviously a lot more nuanced than what happening in the comments here for context i a practicing christian and i prosecuted child sex crimes for years in state court i have no patience for what i found to be naive views about penitent child sex abusers but i also think there is value in counseling with clergy generally the exemption is not about reporting abusive pastors it about pastors not reporting things they learn in confession of course pastors confess abuse as well so the two are mutually exclusive most states still either have this exemption or do require reporting from clergy at all so utah is hardly alone the exemption comes from traditional protections for privileged communication like those for and every state more or less exempts communication about past conduct the us pretty widespread mandatory reporting requirements for mental health professionals are controversial and studies have shown that people avoid treatment over fear of mandatory reporting i believe in an effort to encourage treatment most countries do not require psychologists to report are we fostering more abuse by not allowing abusers to seek professional counseling similarly at least with a generous view this desire for people to freely confess and seek help is the reason for good faith opposition to these changestax religion at least hold them accountable by their pocketbooksi took the step toward mutual respect and understanfing many years ago by relinquishing any identity prescribed by my religious affiliation and i encourage everuone else to do the same also tax the ever loving shit out of churches and hand back that money to the suckers that cpughed it up in the first place in the form of food and shelterwhen is this bullshit going to end i can not stand these organizations and their enablersmormonism is religious abuse thus it will never reports its own abuse typical walled communityoh you mean i must report on muself right no problemand no one is surprisedthat will insure a higher level of child abuse remains in the communityit s cause the people opposing these laws are likely the same people doing the abuse most of our state government is mormon they don t care about separation of church and state hell our governing body that makes alcohol laws are all mormons that have nerve had drink in their life mormons run our state government and we as citizens are powerless as the gop gerrymanders so much her that our voices are never heardthat because the clergy are themselves abusersca believe we need a law to compel these shitbags to report actual abusereligious people love to abuse childrensuprising absolutely no one the clergy in the lds ranks is quite broadbecause of course it did fuck the lds churchi m shocked i tell you shockedof course i know him that me mormonswhat the point of forcing people to report crimes or intention of committing them said in a private confession it just going to lead to the criminal avoid talking about it in confessions which if the crime has a strong psychological nature means they are going to be less likely to receive help to stop their urges and more likely to feel isolated about a topic made taboo which means they are more likely to doing iti lived in slc for 20 years let s just say i m not surprised by thisevery single person who attends a church of any denomination should be protesting the fact that this can even be allowed to happen is proof enough that religious institutions should be stripped of tax exempt status and any federal or state subsidiesany lds lurkers here who can explain why the church believes it s members are above the laws of the statei used to be apart of the whole troubled teen industry got sent to a few places as a teen i can confidently say abuse happens all over the state but mainly mormon its been going on for decades a lot of programs take advantage of the vulnerable it goes all the way up the chain it has to for what they get away with81 of child porn convictions are white males utah not a heavily pigmented demographic it should be posed that way edit pinky offendedshameful religious people hiding the sins of their clergy wonder if their idea of jesus approves but then between money and child abuse maybe they really do have the keys heavennandude is still alive

mental issues that made her susceptible to being groomed yada yada yada like hello do they not vet these people at all anymore or is it a requirement at this pointjesus there are a lot of people in here who do want to admit they understand how a boss could force an employee to have sex with themi think it s funny the police union is afraid to commenthere i was thinking only drag queens engaged in grooming in tennessee obviouslyi wonder if the animals over at efukt are gon na find any videos of this crazy chici was waiting for this surprised it took this longi understand that this is about money and she will likely get paid in a settlement but i do understand how this is grooming iirc she is a married adult woman not a teenager she knew what she was doing and wanted to do it i do see how she is a victim herei really don t think she is as much of a victim as she claims but there is some seriously fucked up behavior by the men who weren t relentlessly mocked onlinegod forbid anyone accept blame for their own actionsi think i believe heri wonder which side the union is onhow the fuck is this grown ass cop getting groomeddeletedyou just wanted dick on the side and got caught for it and now she s trying to save facefrom the sound of things she was the one systematically going through the police department making sure that no dick was left untouchedshe ll probably get something out of this because 2 of them were her bosses but this idea that she was groomed is a joke she s an adult police officer she s responsible for her decisions unless she was coerced or forced but that doesn t really seem like the case because she was sleeping with other officers there toogrooming is the wrong word but she was probably pressured and harassed till she gave inthis is the funniest shit i have read in awhiletwo of them were her bosses so maybe there is something to this legally morally though i going to have to see something pretty coercive for me to side with her on this one at some point adults need to be responsible for their behavior again if there was coercion apart from the fact that two of the many dudes she slept with were her superior then never mindbold move i ve never seen someone sue themselfto think someone went through the trouble of routing out police sex parties i m not saying it s the wrong move but man what a job that must bedumb question here why do we care about consenting adults doing stuff not talking about this new thing of grooming as grooming is bad any article that not about cops killing beating and raping people in custody is kind of an improvement right now maybe i missed something from the main story again if there was grooming they should be punished but up till now they were all consentingi miss coherent article titlesshe is a w word and probably is proud of it she is mad she got caught that s all during for this is just bs as she has no chance of winningno you gave me gibberish once again the discussion was about if the city

our attackers knew we were unarmed whenever we were on campus it was scary to know that i could protect myself at home but that i would be expelled if i tried to do it at school i understand that guns shouldn t be necessary for protection in a civilized society but what do you do when society isn t civilized a restraining order is just a piece of paper and does nothing to protect you police can not

went to college in a state that while not officially shall issue at the time it is now for all intents and purposes was since almost every sheriff in the state issued them without a fuss as it turns out the state ccw was not valid on campus however any student with a state ccw could then just go to the university police department and get a shall issue campus permit in no time at all of course there was a second registration fee that was about twice as much as the state fee so most people rightfully just viewed it as a money grab by the campus police this was in the early 90s so it was

alternate headline world a slightly better place for more than an hourin november after the second wave of layoffs prompted by musk s demand that workers sign a pledge to an extremely hardcore mode of working the chief executive reassured onlookers that twitter would not shut down because of the lack of staff saying the best people are staying so i m not super worried despite that outages at the site have become an increasingly common occurrence according to netblocks wednesday s outage is twitter s fifth this year already putting the platform over halfway towards topping its 2022 total and this is a good example of musk leadership skills or lack thereofhuh didn t notice because fuck twitteryou want to tell me that if you fire all your engineers at a certain point your application stop workingelon has exceeded all my expectations i gave him till april to destroy twitter impressivei left that dumpster fire and never looked back i encourage everyone else to do the sameanyone remember when all the idiots on the internet were all like elon will give us powerrrr and it over for your libs now and twitter belongs to us and then that never happenedits only down for one hour but imagine if it goes down for 24 hours next timethe only reason anyone is still using twitter is because there is an equivalent alternativeand in that hour all of mankind knew peaceoh noes the nazi bar was closed so anywaybut who will spew out racist content who will have the latest retelling of the covid 19 lab theory who will argue about whether or not a person indicated sexual body language and what about the laptopby design twitter is being dismantled to remove a speech tool that allows people of different backgrounds like people who lived under authoritarian dictatorships from organizing one less tool that people have to organize and communicate with each other throughout the world we be naive to think elon financial backers were not very aware of the direction elon planned to take twitter or instructed for that matter now watch what happens to reddit when it iposiqs worldwide trended back toward average during that downtime then plummeted immediately when twitter went back up

downside to deprioritizing every aspect of a nation except for corporate profitsnot going to be too specific here but i know a guy who heads a biotech research laboratory at a major new york university located in manhattan this lab is highly financed but they refuse to do any research on synthetic biology because this individual is a baptist and believes that synthetic biology is contrary to god plan this sort of nonsense is unbelievable but true because of the politics of us academic research you got to have connections to get a job at a research institute and unfortunately in the united states one of the easiest ways to make those conservative political connections is through church attendance and we need to be clear that scientific research in the united states is in fact a very conservative business because so much money is on the line people get quite serious when money is involved a nation that refuses to take risks is going to have a difficult time making technological progress this guy actually thinks the church is a bunch of nonsense but he got his position because of his church connections and he refuses to make waves because he loves his cushy job that he had to play this stupid game to get so he does the right thing and plays along with the game this is so sleazy look at the damage that george bush did to stem cell research with his religious fanaticism about satanic chimeras and the use of aborted fetal cells for research the issues is less that china has a better educational system they do but more that they not encumbered by a reactionary conservative political establishment that worms its way into any high paying position through a social network that originates in religious institutions the politics of power and money in the united states is poisonous to innovation innovators need to be able to take risks nobody takes risks when they obsessively paranoid about losing their privilege and willing to do the dirty work for their buddies in order to hold on to what they got through their connections the privilege that comes with conservative connections is too seductive for many people in tech to resist it not their problem they doing fine that attitude kills progress in the us and leaves the door open for other nations to jump ahead i would expect very little exciting biotech coming out of the us in the coming decades it will come but it will come from overseasask yourself how much does it cost in america to get a education in technology you probably have to mortgage your house to even go to college or your parents will oh and if you graduate you be attacked by a large part of the country as being an elite and educated which they say is badwell of course they are our politicians want to destroy our public education and teach that dinosaurs didnt exist and that the earth is only years oldstages of cope 1 china just uses low skill cheap labor to make crap ca actually make anything decent 2 they can only make better decent products because they steal they do have the research level as us 3 they are only producing low level research in no name journals it not the quantity but the 4 they only lead in high impact research because well we in this stage right now so will be interesting what the cope will be for itthe institute disclosed that its research was funded by the us state department s global engagement center and a grant from the special competitive studies project a foundation that aims to strengthen america s competitiveness surely no bias there it definitely not a naked play at prodding politicians into more fundingthe us celebrates ignorance science recommends vaccines and masks but opinionated grandstanding politicians and pundits are listened to instead in the us the theory of evolution is still controversialno they are propagandathat frightening given the military uses of most of those technologies and china authoritarianismoh boy here we go this really is indicative of an epochal shifthmmm good work china everyone else step it upit reported that china and india together have about 10 times the stem graduates usa stem graduates many are graduating from usa colleges of course in the usa squashing crt and wokism are the most urgent issues for the authoritarian politicos destroying the educational systems in the usa the usa has failed and is now simply a corporate plutocratic oligarchy once the markets fail completely the capitalists will simply pick up and move to next region to plunderwhen they stop teaching kids how to read a clock we were passed up long agomore agitprop fearmongering bullshit fun fact technically we were never on topthose of us who were paying attention in the 1980s remember the same kind of claptrap about japan what up with that there always a computer cyber i worry more about the gap and the health care gapthank you republicansthis is such nonsense peddled to americans don t waste your time on this propagandachina probably paid the think tank to say thata competition between nation states will be won by the state that isn t controlled by people actively destroying the state from withinthis is bs china steals much of its technology from the how the hell can that be an assetnanso my grandpa was a preacher in a rural town in the south he preached at the white church and once a month he would go to the black church for a sunday and give their preacher a break he struck up a friendship with one man in particular and kept inviting him to the white church the man was understandably resistant to this idea but grandpa was one of the most stubborn people anyone could ever come across and wore him down grandpa took the whole we are all children of god thing literally and did see any reason anyone would look down on anyone else due to skin color or orientation or anything else so this guy comes to his church and absolutely everyone ignores him they refused to bring him communion grandpa got down from the pulpit ripped the stuff out of someone hands and took it to him himself then he got back up to the pulpit and told everyone off said how that not behavior and how ashamed he was of all of them that night there was a cross burning on his lawn a week later he moved his family back to his home state if he hadnt had young children he probably would have stayed and fought it out when i think of all these so called christians and their horrible bullshit i think of my grandpa and how ashamed he would be of all of them i an agnostic now but i so proud to come from a man who would stand for bigotry who read the bible and actually accepted judge not without reservationadmirable action taking the stance that they did but im kind of surprised they weren t anticipating more loss than just 50 religious institutions get a lot of their funds through donors with religious interests and going against the grain like that inadvertently bit the hands that fed them far more than they were able to do make do with pettiness on the donors parts for pulling their support over such an absurd reason but not a whole lot that can be done about itchristians put a lot of strings attached to love thy neighbor if jesus were to return and openly embrace the lgbtq community their little heads would explodefound some real cancel cultureit not enough for them that in their belief system we get to suffer for all of eternity for how their god made us they must also try to hurt us in this world as well got ta love christiansthe world shall know that you are my disciples if you have love one for anothertolerance and inclusion are simply not christian values evangelicals have so much in common with the talibani think this is a good teaching example because it reveals some insight regarding how christians function in secular society quoting from my father who was an episcopalian for many years and is now part of the acna over similar issues https moderate christians tend to deal with politics by not dealing with them they rationalize their avoidance of taking a difficult stance by abstracting the issue gay people are considered sinners but all of us are sinners who are we to judge etc you can get surprisingly tolerant behavior out of christians with this angle but as soon as your organization takes a stance that explicitly contradicts church doctrine you force them out of this abstract ambiguity and make them confront it directly do i actually believe in my religion 1 you will very likely lose in this confrontation moral of the story if you feel that strongly about the issue you should secure alternative funding before you explicitly contradict words in the bible and force your donors to predicate continued support on abandoning their faith 1 i recall a church meeting over the issue of gay bishops where my dad said look at this point we might as well shut the whole thing down and head on over to the unitarians they nice people they be happy to have us and it would be more honest than pretending that we believe in anything at all that did not go over wellwe were banking on the tolerance and unconditional love of christiansif the bible is real if jesus was real i bet ya hundred bucks he already came back and some republican shot him for being a dirty hippiethat sucks but the kids are better off in public school anywayjust remember people you don t need a religion to believe in a higher power faith comes from within not from a bookweird their website https still has a donation page https wonder if they could continue if they received additional fundingcharter schools and private schools are helping to deplete resources and funding for public schools sad that only the morally sound one is closing downfor being christians they sure do pass judgment a lot smdhsomehow these christians think this is what jesus would do they better hope that whole jesus thing is not real if they hope to avoid an eternity in hellthe problem with christianity besides the fact that it is utter contradictory bullshit is that the old testament and the new testament give entirely separate rules of behavior and judgement old testament god demands death for everything from adultery to disrespecting your parents to just being on land that the israelites wanted for example psalm blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the old testament god was vengeful unforgiving blood thirsty and everything was an abomination worthy of severe punishment which is exactly how modern christians behave being gay is an abomination in the old testament but when jesus comes along suddenly god is all chilled out and telling everyone to forget all that stuff my father commanded before and just love each other so what is a modern christian supposed to do toss out 90 of the book that is the cornerstone of their faith and listen solely to the zenned out hippie the obvious answer that we see every day is a resounding no most of the bible most christians and human nature in general skews towards dominance judgement fear of the unknown and a malignant need for superiority jesus doctrine never stood a chance so good luck to all my fam in the community looking for support and acceptance with this hopelessly misled group of people there are some good ones but by and large it a shit show and remember that any religion where hate and exclusion is the result is the real abominationi am an atheist i was raised in a southern baptist family i always wondered what is it about christianity that some lgbtq people are so attracted to that they want to be a part of something and belong to a group that overwhelmingly wants nothing to do with themits not jesus its his followers that annoy me went 12 years to a baptist school and forced to church 3 times a week even if your eyes were bleeding the most like racist hate filled bigots i ever met and i sorry to say that i was 1 once jesus might have been love but thats the first thing ignoredone of the easiest ways to obtain power is to stoke hatred feelings of inadequacy or self doubt are redirected to a group upon which the masses collectively agree represents an enemy it s core though is each individual s desire to feel better about themselves hypocrisy or logic is irrelevant since it is about the individual s self image hatred is a drug to the masses bigotry is the vehicle but hate is the fuel the leaders of these groups are not interested in the actual religious teachings but rather how it can be harnessed for their own benefit the benefits they pursue are money influence and ultimately power over others these are not religious leaders they are psychological drug dealers preying on self doubt religion is a means to an end for them and saving souls is the public face they put on in reality they are hanging curtains in an outhouse because if they preached love and tolerance they would not be able to use hatred to fuel their ministryit goes to show just how intolerant churches arewhat happened to jesus loves all his children smhas a christian myself i think it s really cool that they were trying to demonstrate jesus actual message of love rather than the condemnation that so many christian s unfortunately perpetuate i hope their efforts brought about some healing before it got shut downi tried explaining to my devout religious family that this type of continued behavior is what will drive people away from the church entirelyi still do understand why anyone in our community would want to attend a church or send their kids to a religious school in the first place they hate us as it isthis country is losing its damn mind it is becoming scaryso forget the whole what would jesus do thinga christian church actually acting like christ nope ca have thatcons not that kind of christiansai no hate like christian loveby teaching them tolerance acceptance and even to celebrate the gay lifestyle you are setting them on a course to embrace the world and philosophy this quote from one of the messages the school received is completely of jesus he was all about tolerance and acceptancejust like jesus would ve done since he so famously didn t like ppl he didn t understand or necessarily agree with especially children does anyone else wonder what religion christians actually practice and whether it s subterfuge or just actual stupidity in the mix upthe problem was looking for kindness from christianity your supposed to provide an undeserved sense of righteousness and bigotry through shamingending contributions seems like the christian thing to doi always get a kick out of businesses that are based doing background checks on potential employees and denying them on that basis and me reminding them that jesus was a convicted felonthe cult attacks itself evenyou know those christians arnt the most forgiving types of peopleit was just that we anticipated a 50 loss in funding and made adjustments for that we had an 80 loss in funding and that was too much to overcome christian love folksthere is no hate quite like christian lovei am firmly against all forms of private schools they are a way to drain resources from public schools and legally discriminate against people based on schools should be fully nationalized fund everything from the same revenue pool have kids from all backgrounds in the same system the wealthy would have an incentive to make the schools as good as possible because their kids are attending and religious bigots would be able to instill their worldview on children it would have a profoundly positive impact on societywhat a hateful religion the ironychristianity in the 21st century is just a smoke screen for prejudices and to feel superior to others at this point it meaning light are all but extinguished thanks to political hijacking and commercializationnone of them are oblivious they all think they live so christ like their actions are all forgiven on sunday anyways so they don t have to be oblivious they just have to repent every sunday and all is goodi think that nobody can present a better mission statement for what the christian community should be like than be more like jesus the problem is that some of these dumbos think jesus was a white american who would have shot gays with hiswho could have foreseen this happeningwhen confronted with the option to accept everyone or cease operating the donors chose the latter the sad part is that they think they did the right thing when jesus had a specific parable showing that they didi thinking of those new jesus commercials he loved the people we hatei agnostic but it gives me great pleasure thinking about all the christans who just arent getting into the heaven they think exists due to simply being assholes who use religion as an excusethese stances under the guise of righteousness like this one by teaching them tolerance acceptance and even to celebrate the gay lifestyle you are setting them on a course to embrace the world and philosophy are exactly why people are leaving religion in droves a pew research center survey found 29 of adults said they had no religious affiliation an increase of 6 percentage points from 2016 you are not setting the world on a course to embrace god when you categorize that god is a being who only excepts one thing despite the evidence being to the contrary around of the population is born with intersex traits 2 of the population has red hair for an idea of how common intersexuality is if there is a god and he could come down and speak to these people their heads would explode at the cognitive dissonance ringing in their earsfucking right wing christians who are anything but christianthe seem to have a very strange interpretation of loving and accepting all they are no better than some religions that strike back and kill parishions who dare to object to tenets of that leadership shameful christians sadly many have been by far right evangelicans who do give a damn about christ they want power not religious guidance no better than the charlatans selling magic potions in bottleswhen you don t understand your own business modelthe essence of the christian faith is promoting and offering love she said it okay to believe that solely for oneself but it not good to spread that fiction to childrenwhat would jesus do really he d be displeased with our lack of loving each other that s all that s been asked of usmessages from individuals were far more blunt one read do not call yourself a christian school if you are affirming sin jesus died to set us free from sin i point out the things jesus said about being lgbt except that he considered it too important to ever mention so i instead just cite all the times he hung out with lepers prostitutes divorced womem samaritans tax collectors romans and all sorts of other people the religious authorities considered sinful by definitionthe christian hate wing in action they define themselves by who they condemn in the name of christgood keep tearing the christian down it a giant scam and this article highlights exactly what is going on if you do like our ideas then you do get our money christianity they taking money away from poor kids and we suppose to believe that they good peoplejesus would never be allowed to stay in the republican party today and would be thrown out of a lot of his own churchesthis is because religion isn t about love it s about controllooks like there no room for doing the right thin in christianitythe school is literally in line with what the pope is preaching who leads the church people just want to believe their own version and own interpretations of things which in itself is inherent to human behavior it just upset me as a person the hate that comes from religionjesus loves everyone until his followers don t you idiots don t even follow the teachings in your dumbass bible you hide behind you cherry pick whatever feels good at the moment from that man made book how about you just live the way you think you live while pretending to be a good person at church oh that s right sunday is the only day you have to pretend the other 6 days are for you to be absolute hell to everyone around you good christian valuesthe new testament suffer the little children to come unto me american performative christians suffer the little children with gay parents to go to hellit s like ancient religions don t jibe with 21st century social mores and never will wildchristian love at work i hate hypocrites95 of xtian give the rest a bad nameso why does the lbtq community stand up and fund the schoolreligion sucks but it s nice that they did thisbut at least he gets us righti see what they might have been trying to do it is not the healthy who need doctors but the sickthat s because christianity and lgb are at odds all the major abrahamic faiths are you can try to warp reality claim the religion needs a reformation attempt to skew interpretation of the scripture and practice of it call out the hypocrisy but the simple reality is homosexuality is considered a major sinthe catholic school that i went to for high school had openly gay teachers and a glea club gay and lesbian education and affirmation and that was damn near 30 years ago still going strong that school i think it really depends on your location and how much of the population is homophobic assholes accepting and interested in quality educationbecause they congregation understand jesus words so wella lengthy letter from one church which characterized the community as a diverse collection of behaviors explained our greatest concern about the accepting and affirming stance is that it denies the biblical definitions of sin and identity and thereby renders the grace of god meaningless when we say all current christian and catholic churches are so deeply intertwined with bigotry that they are inseparable this is what we are talking about you can believe gay people are all sinners you can not do so any not be considered a bigot you can not legitimately get mad when others call you a bigot it is not their fault that you are acting out the dictionary definition of the word if you want people to stop calling you that word stop behaving in that waydeletedmy question to these people would be you be fine with someone using christianity as an excuse to be racistremovedshame this school had to close at least there are some decent christians left trying to do the right thing and salvage their barbaric religion at least they triedlame nothing says caring about each other like saying everyone but who i think we hate i hope god does exist just so people like this get their justice will really suck when god says i said be kind to your neighbors and all you did was spread hate you are the weakest link goodbye godreligion should be about hope and being there for others they failedit sad that the loudest voices in christianity are the most hateful and bigoted and sad that our society is giving into to these bigots we need christians who are accepting and tolerant to drown them outthis is christianity love and acceptance have no place here seriously fuck those donors that pulled support fuck them with a cactuswith all the rich gays out there they couldn t get enough donations to cover for the bigotry that was leaving it seems that the people running the school didn t really believe in what they were teaching as when it got hard they foldedcentral to the teaching of jesus is that sitting in judgment of man is the dominion of god alone thus we are ordered to be boundless in our forgiveness and are only in a state of grace are only in communion with him when we have only love in our hearts when we sit in judgment of others we steal from god s dominion with most of our sins the victims are our neighbors or even more likely our own selves but when we judge others we are acquiring an authority that does not belong to us we are actually stealing directly from god s dominion we are committing the crime of theft and the victim of that crime is god himself not the person you are judging it amazes me how many people identify as christian but then are so openly hostile to the teaching of christ the retort i so often hear is that it s possible to subscribe to a group and not believe every belief that group espouses as if jesus s order to love and forgive was something he just mentioned in passing that one time and didn t want us to get all hung up on or that it s possible to have similar beliefs but not interpret certain messages the same way as if jesus s order to live with love and forgiveness in our hearts was some subtle vaguely worded thing he mentioned in passing that one time so who can fault us for missing itjesus wo know the christians that opposed this schoolthat dude marge is right we need a national divorce the gun religous lunatics can have the south east and good luck but the main rule once you go you cant come back you stuck in aholelandremovedthese people just make shit up to justify their own hatred of what is different our greatest concern about the accepting and affirming stance is that it denies the biblical definitions of sin and identity and thereby renders the grace of god meaningless lol this is an absurdity a sentence of gobbledygook a string of words that collectively has no real meaning other than we don t like the community so screw you all draped in a 2000 year old book written long after jesus supposedly lived that also supports repeated genocides infanticides matricides patricide regicides rape incest misogyny rampant and death penalties for so many commonly conducted activities that we d all be 6 under if we actually followed the good book yeah no thanks i m sorry the school is closing but it s one more reason to walk away from these bigoted moral institutions that are anything butchristianity is being refined into a grotesque ball of hatred and bigotry rational decent people aren t required to be dogmatic and obedient so they are mostly toned down casuals or just flat out left the faith more and more the bigots are making up the majority while driving everyone else out now crosses and loudly self identifying as a christian is usually synonymous with bigotry and hatred and the new generations are the most on record between that and christian groups constant assaulting our rights i don t see the young flocking back to what is an oppressive and hateful force in their lives any time soonit crazy that the most bigoted christian sects in america are given a monopoly on the label values voters even in supposedly mainstream objective media outlets meanwhile actual christians get erased from the scenenanwow have heard about havana syndrome in a whilemy guess is methanol contamination of beveragesthey discovered the brown noisehave they solved changnesia yetthe whole premise was incredibly flimsy to begin with there was never any certainty of what kind of device could cause these things no physical evidence of a weapon and the symptoms of those who allegedly suffered from it were often extremely minimal and resembled what most people would assume is a normal hangover did stop them from getting funding thoughsurely you could have got the department of housing to say its china faultca read past the paywallit s always been a case of mass hysteria it s terrifying that our intelligence agencies can t get to grips with thati got massively downvoted when this was in the news for saying it was most likely psychosomatic sigha yet unsurprising report by the intel community concludes that they were just stupid this whole entire time i am still baffled by the mindset of i have a headache must be directed energy weapons as opposed to something like maybe this building ventilation suckspublicly reported intelligence review doesn t really mean much im not making a claim one way or another but im surprised so many people are so quick to believe the report i dont really care one way or another but there was more documentation to the sympoms than what some of the top comments would suggest if i was a conspiracy theorist i may say plantedlike i said at the time if it was caused by some energy weapon or foreign adversary the united states might as well surrender now because people were supposedly being targeted outside of places such as just outside the white house https as we first told you in february our reporting has found senior national security officials who say they were stricken in washington and on the grounds of the white house if senior national security officers can be targeted just outside of the white house there is no defensethere was some speculation that this was caused by some electronic counter measures at our embassies so if that were the case this statement would still be factually correctthat news organization should be named washingtonpaywallyet we re suppose to suddenly believe covid leaked from chinese labone man havana laugh joke accidentally gets investigatedyes we have no havanas we have no havanas todaythey probably just took some sketchy research chems at an office party and had to play it offit us spy equipment on the embassy top floor whatever they been running was more important than the staff health also why you never have it officially solvedi love it when we spend millions of dollars so that a bunch of government types can throw their hands in the air and go dunno also when did we start trusting intelligence agencies to tell the public the truththis shit legit scares meyeah it turns out the laws of physics are pretty inflexible and magic undetectable energy beams are actually a thing who coulda knowedi want to be absolutely clear these findings do not call into question the experiences and real health issues that us government personnel and their family members including cia s own officers have reported while serving our country burns saiddeletedmy guess it was an unintended of a surveillance technology or tech we ca admit we know what it is without risking people figuring out our capabilitieswas this proven in 2019 to be nothing more than insecticide or neurotoxin here the cbc article https c3a lot of you are commenting without knowing all the details havana syndrome affected more than just people in cuba so saying it was cuban rum or something specific to cuba is it affected people in russia and some asian countries also the government saying it is real does hold much water need a third party review i not saying it real or caused by energy weapons i do know but it should be written off so easilyi wonder if they screened for an exotic parasite like one of those brain amoeba thingsyeah it was mass hysteria we greatly over and underestimate our brainsa bunch of paranoid flatfoots ran out of spoons and got it in their heads that it must be a secret communist anxiety laser and after years of investigations several agencies have finally said that the secret communist anxiety laser is a dumb idea for babieswhat i learned about redditors from stories about havana syndrome and mandela effect are that you all are scared shitless of the possibility that things are what they seem you are scared of things we ca explain and because of this you are just dismissive in the face of a lot of evidence you can rationalize it away all day if you want but we both know that not fucking honest and it kind of pathetic what i read hereodds we did it to our own peoplethe people who suffered from this got tax payers funded medicare for life a privilege the current and previous government decided normal people should getis there some scientific study on highfrency radio waves pointing at body parts etchavana syndrome is the power of suggestion mixed with fear of the unknown and likely normal body sensations under anxiety once you think somethings happening and later events or things lead you to further believe those things are happening it becomes a feedback loop of reinforcementhey look another trump admin item shown to be fake who could have guessedthey should just blame everything on china vote to approve billion dollar defense systems that will never be used become a lobbyist for the companies that created the defense systems that will never be used once everyone is sick of hearing about china go back to islamic extremism or iran or whatever vote to approve billion dollar defense systems that will never be used become a lobbyist for the companies that created the defense systems that will never be used once everyone is sickhow to not say group hysteriaquelle surprise good thing we shoveled money at all those people then remember the asshole who wanted to nuke countries as retaliation for his anxiety attacksis it a prerequisite to be an absolute lying piece of shit to work in certain governmental positionslol people will believe anything the government saysso what is it caused by eldritch titans peeling micropockets in spacetime probablytwo words moscow signalidk the recent podcast series paints a different picture httpsweird dueling conspiracies in the comments on one side secret communist energy weapons and on the other mass anxiety attack that somehow inflicted more damage on more people than normally possible but since the latter group is also complaining about the victims getting medical care and compensation they are definitely the assholes here my personal third path conspiracy theory is that it might have been an accident involving any number of chemicals and poor ventilation choices i worked in a manufacturing plant where a mass poisoning if the wrong things were heated or mixed was very possible so that informs my interpretationi do believe this anymore than i believe their opinions on infectious diseasesthey all us intelligence right maybe it guiltnanin another woke attack on this nations generous job providers the biden administration has fined packers sanitation services simply for offering job opportunities to 13 year old kids and allowing them the highly coveted role of cleaning saws with highly caustic chemicals because of this liberal overreach we can expect to see unemployment of 13 year kids again skyrocket forcing them to endure middle school when they should be learning how to be a productive employee with the remaining fingers they haveprobe what the obvious solution is to arrest the employee who authorized underaged kid to be hired in the first place as well as managers who looked the other way and the president because he is in charge of the company and lastly fine heavily the profit generated by these unfortunate juvenile employees to make it stick to company to change their waythe company will get fined not the individuals responsible we should stop doing that blackstone owns that pssi outfit ceo of blackstone is like 1 wall street guy donating to gop and big trump supporter might as well be wearing a teflon suitnani on disability and rely on snap for food if i did live in rhode island which is continuing to auto max out our benefits i be fucked after how drastically food prices have inflated that federal bonus was huge for a lot of familiesthe emergency increase brought snap up to where it should have been all alongit literally insane that people go hungry in the usa it crazy we throw away enough food each day to feed everyone in this country many times over half the country is obese and yet around 10 of the population is food insecure this is what unfettered capitalism gets you we can send billions of dollars to fight foreign wars but feeding and housing people here in this country is impossibleforced birth and no money for food or daycare are the gop such godly peoplethis is an utterly short sighted and malicious move helping people with additional snap benefits also helps the local economy as these people will spend more at their local markets this is going to affect the bottom line of quite a few businesses as well as putting the squeeze on people already strugglingi ca believe more democrats did fight to keep this we need more progressives in congresswe are also collaborating with states and external partners so that they can manage the changes with knowledge and confidence problem is you ca eat knowledge and confidencerepublicans bootstraps free handouts welfare queens derrrrrp also every single truck at the local food bank trump 2024politicians really love digging their own graves do theymaybe now people can go to their local churches for food i am sure they can afford it i mean i think that was part of the purpose of getting donations tax free they must have tons of money to feed the masses people in need hit up your local churcheshorrible timing years ago the republicans wanted it cut because it helped encourage people not to work here we are in recession and food prices are sky high the trump tax increases are crushing the lower and middle classes we keep hearing about how people are starting to take on debt to maintain i would expect some pretty big fallout from thisthe anytime food pantries in my area are almost always bare sometimes there is nothing there we go to a place that is mostly free bread and if you do not go first thing there is almost nothing it is so so hard we have had just enough income to cover cobra insurance until that runs out switched careers and it is not going great i do not think we qualify because there is some money in the bankmy mom is a retiree and with her fixed income she was getting extra snap benefits with this ended i wonder if she will be able to make ends meet on her own she a proud woman and wo ask me for help if she needs itthe eaters got ta starve while those who do do shit for this country live largethis is gon na have reverberations in more ways than any of these politicians can know snap and link match are integral to the funding of a lot of farmers markets and farmers get a significant portion of their sales through these systems our local market triples your dollars to spend at the market on local goodsthe consolidated appropriations act which had a vote of passed and was sent to the president to sign 200 republicans voted no in thisin texas some in the military use snap for all those claiming these should go to them guess are also having to got to the food bank example httpsi am permanently disabled and use food stamps due to issues with my digestive system that took around 8 years for my doctors to diagnose a lot of my diet is ensure meal replacement drinks they re made by the same company responsible for the formula shortage during the shortage the company stopped making ensure and it became impossible to find when it came back they stopped selling the large boxes and i can only get six packs now the large boxes were 20 for 16 the six packs are 12 since the boxes don t seem to ever be returning my monthly grocery bills gone up massively but yeah let s cut the benefits now when all food is double what it used to costnot a good look when you re pouring billions into ukrainewait till people snap out on them due to hungerlame wages and benefits should go up with inflation i so sick of reading articles that say inflation is actually good for working class people i do wish they would restructure snap to not include soda and junk food though then dollar general the only grocery store in many poor rural communities would probably start carrying producekeep voting for politicians that hate youwell actually if people has less spending money is a good thing inflation will lower on the other hand the poor will be poorerwill food prices go down a little with decreasing demandnandammmmn didn t even make the runoff that s an impressive lossshe literally offended everyone and didn t have a cluea shock to absolutely no one except lori lightfoot because she

theft if you do want to get robbed do pay for things with cash 2 years into her term she declared she would only respond to reporters of color suspending the freedom of information act deadlines so the city was distracted from fighting covid while repeatedly demanding her staff communicate in ways that ca be access via foia requests in the future https but apparently forgetting the emails she sent demanding it were exempt from foia requests which is how we know the city is fighting lawsuits https over her over denials of documents from foia requests when she claimed https 99 of her critics

italians i have the biggest in the entire scandal involving her campaign going to teachers and saying she give students credit if they volunteered to work for the campaign not only was it illegal the fallout involved getting caught in multiple lies about what she know and then eventually blaming it all on her campaign manager saying she did know any better but it all good now in the current race she recently suggested that if black people were going to vote for her they should vote at all when she decided anyone the da charged was automatically guilty we shouldn t be locking up nonviolent individuals just because they can t afford to pay bail lightfoot said during a monday afternoon press conference on public safety in chicago but given the exacting standards that the state s attorney has for charging a case which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt when those charges are brought these people are i actually agree with her about some of the releases for alleged violent offenders chicago has gone crazy there with the state attorney kim foxx refusing to prosecute gangbangers shooting each other as mutual combat among other things but she a lawyer and you hope would understand just how damaging a statement like that is for ongoing and upcoming cases what amazing is what a darling she was considered by the political elite within and most especially outside the city but it

vallas s tough on crime approach has a good chance of just increasing police misconduct and brutality i hope i m wrongi think in all reality she will be the most relieved of everyone she looked like she constantly hated her jobthis thing did absolutely nothing positive for the city of chicago she s a racist who declared she would only give interviews to black reporters the only reason she got elected is because she s a black gay woman now she s saying that s the reason she got defeated crime soared under her governance lack thereof and the gold coast became uninhabitable we left the city specifically because of her refusal to let the police do their jobs next to go i hope kim foxx she s just as bad as lightfoot jussie smollet being only one of many examples letting gangs have shootouts and then not prosecuting them both trash both need to go this is a good startthe people have spokenshe was a scapegoat for lots of problems that already existed in chicago politics x200b that being said she was not a good orator she only ever seemed capable of shifting blame and could help but piss off seemingly everyone x200b car centric city seriously my uncle lived on the north side for 40 years he owned a car for maybe 10 of those one was stolen in the 90s and he did replace it until 2005 when my grandma died and gave him her buickyay totally cluelessher experience as the mayor of a major city will probably make her a for any election she cares to stand for in her home town of innsmouthwell that s what happens when you suckchicago has rejected the person the policies are still doing damagethank goodness she is an awful personam i the only one stuck on her name what is she a hobbitgood for chicago residents to actually tell a politician that in order to get you need to show results this needs to happen in the us house and senatethat what happens when you ugly and incompetent i guesswell maybe she needs to ask herself why she thinks that is could be now maybe i going out on a limb here could be that she sucked at her job i dunno just herefair thee well mayor ackbar some of the decisions she made during her tenure were incomprehensibly baffling just a thoroughly incompetent individual and chicago is better for her no longer being mayor here to hoping the next guy sets the bar a bit higher whether it johnson or vallas also suuuuper excited my home city will soon be saying goodbye to it incompetent buffoon of a mayor as welli wonder how much that yelp review absolutely ruined her careershe looks like one of those aliens from that early sega genesis gamejohnson will make a good mayor i thinkwhen i read the name i immediately thought of the character in the lotr tv seriesbeetlejuice has been the worst thing that has happened to an already struggling city i surprised it has been thrown out of officeall that johnson or anyone needs to defeat vallas is to position him as a pro speed light camera proponentdeletedi usually lean democrat depending on the specific topic being discussed but she sucked as mayor and should be voted out between her and the dumb asses in cook county like kim foxx they seem determined to make life easy for criminalshad high hopes when she was overwhelmingly elected she almost immediately showed her true self beyond having the ability to offend everyone she was just vulgar and not in a funny way she did great harm to the city and no one was really the better for her term in office other than her cronies i think what a lot of us did not know was she got her start in the machine in mayor daley s office her problem from the start was she tried to steam roll everyone but never understood she hadn t the clout yet nor the organization to build or run the machine let us hope the next mayor can be a positive force for gooddidn t even come in second place but third place huge yikes that s called losing on an atrocious level who would ve thought ppl wouldn t like her policies crime up by 50 in a year maybe most incompetent mayor of all time how can somebody do such a terrible job shockershe always seemed better suited at being a batman villain than mayor anywayvallas has the backing of the chicago fraternal order of police well that reassuringi know she was reelected due to her poor performance but looking like betelgeuse ca have helpedshe is incredibly racistclassic reddit 63 of chicago residents say they don t feel safe and reddit commenters go to actshually crime isn t a problem since it s up everywhere you can sit and argue how much a mayor can change the crime in a city however it s an issue that needs to be addressed and the reality is criminals aren t scared of punishments anymore especially teens who start getting into crimes since they get let go pretty easily it s why they re targeted by gangsi pray for the speedy recovery of that at one time great citynani find it hilarious to imagine a man grabbing a big outside a walmart and carrying it around with him

smallnanlooks like she makes some shitty decisionsdamn i called it yesterday that the baby was unfortunately going to be found dead i still wish that i had been wrongthis clown world is full of trashthis just makes me very sad i have a little one they so utterly helpless when they born they feel every emotion at 100 the idea of a baby being left alone in such a way is just sickening how could anyone do this why not just the child somewhere is there enough suffering in the world without doing something like thisfuck it i believe in the death penalty now fry these sick fucksnancute how hard they worked to avoid using the word deliberatelybut she said the fbi was not aware of actionable intelligence indicating that a large mob would storm the capitol building absolutely fucking infuriating all of us internet randos were following along without any trouble i figured how to watch the live stream from a different country and stocked up on booze the day before because it was so insanely unquestionably clear what they were going to doignored is a funny way to spell suppressedyeah no shit even i knew some shit was going to go down at the capitol on jan 6th weeks before it happened just because i occasionally visit forums and it was all they were talking about if i knew some shit was going to happen then it s 100 guaranteed the government did as wellso an entity that supposedly targets wrongdoing is going to let this slide this should not be about agencies it should be about the leadership of these agencies intentionally sitting on their hands and most are still working at the same agencies unchallenged who refused to to call in the national guard i do wan na hear about bad optics i want a fucking name and then i want a firing followed by a grand jury investigation i want every single treasonous fuckwit who deleted their phone conversations fired next none of that is going to happen because traitors hiding in plain sight have buddies up top what an embarrassmentdude my redneck neighbor bet me they were gon na storm the capitol and i called him an idiot because that would be a place you can t just run into he s not an insider a lot of ppl knew about thiseven the sober ap used insurrection in their news storiesthe wikipedia timeline on this is illuminating perhaps the intelligence agencies could skim the article https this part for instance november 9 trump fires secretary of defense mark esper and replaces him with christopher miller as acting secretary 26 27 28 29 in response to the firings cia director gina haspel privately tells chair of the joint chiefs milley that we are on the way to a coup 30the cbs coverage https includes a lot of specific examples capitol police obtained information regarding a tip that a member of the proud boys had recently obtained ballistic helmets armored gloves vests and purchased weapons including a sniper rifle and suppressors for the weapons t he individual flew with others to washington on january 5 2021 to incite violence department of homeland security reviewed a tip a day before the 6 attacks about an individual who had staked out parking lots of federal buildings to determine how to bring firearms into at january 6th events t hreat against the water system between 16 2020 4 2021 a total of 27 threat products specific to the planned events of january 6 prior to the attack on the capitol according to the obtained report the gao found that 14 products included an assessment of the likelihood that violence could occur a social media post where the user described intent to conduct an attack in washington on january 6 targeting democratic members of congress fbi officials we spoke with said that from december 29 2020 through january 6 2021 they tracked domestic terrorism subjects that were traveling to washington and developed reports related to january 6 events said the report as of january 6 2021 fbi officials noted that the washington field office was tracking 18 domestic terrorism subjects as potential travelers to the area but ya know just a whole bunch of tourists wandering around or something edit fixed bad linkignored they were instructed to stand downit s crazy that we are even talking like no one knew everyone knew this was going to happen the news was talking about it unreal that our intelligence departments failed to see what was right in front of them then again you are only as good as your manager when you have a yellow cheeto with zero management skills running the country just look at the swamp he made trump did such a major disservice to the world and to the country and yet you have his ball danglers still pushing his shit it s fucking gross and embarrassingmaga individuals were talking about civil war forever online let alone the preparation for it was right in the open and only a matter of timeand now we know why the fbi is suddenly talking about a lab leak the story of their collusion in an attempted coup will be buriedit was all over twitter for months before it happenedeverybody and their moma knew what was gon na happen truly a worst kept secret even got warnings from work to avoid the metro around dc if possiblenot for nothing but i do it would have been great if those idiots had the national guard to fight against that daywas the whole point supposedly of homeland security dept to get intelligence agencies talking to each other and sharing informationif only there was some agency perhaps even a department whose task was coordinating efforts and intelligence across the other agencies in order to protect homeland securityamerica was at its weakest on jan 6th the failure to act from these agencies will be felt over the next few years as we descend further into authoritarianismthere was tons of angst amongst trumps top teams in the build up to jan 6 exactly because everyone knew this would go down if he didn t win the election many many top officials did nothing to prevent itignored by the people that were actively involved in planning facilitating an insurrectioni still wish the capitol police had their auto weapons and had used them to full effect everyone knew what was going to happen the fbi essentially tried to let it succeed they had actionable intelligence the very day that diaper donald tweeted it will be wild they intentionally did nothing they and others who were given the task of protecting democracy were intent on destroying it for a con man in leaky dependsi took off work to watch it they knewthis should shock anyone even as a brit it was obvious something was going to happen that day i used to keep an eye on subreddit and site to see what they were saying and it was obvious they were planning something they kept referring to jan 6th as crossing the rubicon so convinced was i that i set up two monitors when working from home and watch cnn and fox news live all day and watched it all unfoldyeah no shit this would have never happened if the nut jobs did have allies and coordinators inside the capitol itself if they ever try this again they need to be handled without kid gloves and i mean that in the most cruel way imaginable no civility towards insurrectionistshow did a bunch of nerds on reddit clearly see this coming but a group of highly trained well supported nicely equipped intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies completely miss it this should have been a surprise to anybody who was even i was far more surprised at the lack of a response than the actual event and i just a guy who reads the newsthanks to the bbc for this story but this is a rerun of agencies not sharing information and a litany of obvious clues ignored the result from was homeland security crawling into every aspect of citizens lives but nothing to show for all of those privacy invasions hindered an assault on the us capitol bragged about in advancea lot of people on the right hoping for a full on overthrow of the governmentmaga was given enough rope and they hung themselves negligent or intentional they did it to themselves however there could be some culpabilityinsurrection not riot the fact that many police were colluding was already knownno shit everyone knew it was coming it was very telegraphed reddit knew for weeksyou mean trump and his cronies wanted it to happen this is shockingever wonder why there weren t any counter protestors yeah because everybody knew it was a coupwell that s because it wasn t a riot it was a coup attemptimagine going to jail for trump big lollike the tweets saying they were going to overthrow the governmentit wasnt ignored trump and otehr republicans actively worked to prevent measure to stop it he forbid the dc police from putting up stanchions and riot fences up the day before jan 6th like they wanted to he gave order to the national guard to not mobilize and be in place for if violence broke out again they wanted to do it but he told them no and he actively prevented emergency response plans from being enacted the day ofhere a tip trump did it now will there be any consequences for an attempted coup spoiler alert nothey were not ignored the government plans were then changed to make them weaker to try to help the coup to succeedit s not surprising the fox was in charge of hen house security during that timejust another balloon derailment lableak capital riot news storywere ignored by both parties because both sides wanted that shit show to happenit said the rally that preceded the riots was not designated a national special security event by capitol police which would have resulted in increased security measures how the fuck was it not a national special security event when the goddamn president of the united states was there hosting said eventtrump was basically live tweeting that it was going to happen i did need a watchdog to prove they ignored the signs it was pretty obviouschris wray needs to be removed from fbi he let jan 6 happen he let charles mcgonigal happenthis is what the department of homeland security was supposed to be for remember all of the govt agencies realized after that they were siloed up and decided to create our largest bureaucratic agency to make sure these things never happen again well this is how it is going these will never get over their little contests and just do basic communication because of all the macho toxic bullshit i am so over ita more accurate description is fbi helped coup plot to remain undetectedreally weird also in all seriousness what if anything is going to happen to christopher miller was he not a head bee guy besides domestic terrorist myke flynn piece of shit brothersomething something something some fuckin thing goddammitnansounds like another mentality ill person being processed through the criminal justice system instead of being offered help thanks reaganwhy is it illegal to burn something that you ownjust a little early spring cleaningnantoxicology reports revealed that lecroy was driving with a blood alcohol concentration of more than double the legal limit evidence indicated that shortly before the crash the expedition was traveling at about 104 miles per hour the ford expedition driven by lecroy was rented by the university for recruiting purposes lecroy was not authorized to drive the expeditiona lot going on here lecroy recruiting analyst was racing the expedition weaving in and out of traffic including at 104mph while drunk with a bac of she crashed killing herself and willock o lineman carter was racing the trackhawk given to him as part of an nil deal with the dealership left the scene after the crash presumably so that he could claim that he was distraught and slamming drinks after the crash not drunk driving now instead he charged with reckless driving and racing both misdemeanors jamon smael mondon linebackers also returned to the scene at a later time no charges for them but was charged with street racing 5 days earlier what a bunch of fucking assholes good thing they only killed themselves losing control of a nearly vehicle on a city street at mph could have easily resulted much worse hopefully the nfl takes it seriously doubtful and this derails carter career at the most pivotal moment as for the nil deal what kind of idiot do you have to be to gift an irresponsible college football star a 700hp suv how is that ever going to end well for your brandpolice initially believed the crash was a accident caused by speeding however statements and evidence have since revealed at least two other cars were at the scene both driven by georgia football players police have not released surveillance video citing the footage as evidence in an ongoing investigation i suspect there is far more to this story than we knowso the cowboys or raiders are going to draft him thenso he disappears for an hour returns to the scene an hour later and will claim he had a few drinks while away who said college football players aren t dumb the perfect outthey race tracks for racing and the salt flats for top speed use themhonestly i blame these new nil deals as money is flooding in for 19 and and the at these colleges have little to no control over the money or gifts carter had endorsed a ohio luxury car dealer appearing in a video in which he roars away in a 2021 black jeep cherokee trackhawk he was given one of these cars from the article with a engine known as a hellcat the vehicle has a top speed of 180 mph and can accelerate from zero to 60 in about three seconds used models retail arounddisgusting behavior but not too surprising given that kirby smart has built a football program that not only encourages and enables bad behavior but actively covers it up if he had any integrity as a human being he have resigned already two people are dead because of his program and he does give two shits about themi shocked that an athlete is attempting to avoid legal accountability in a profession with a long history of integrity maturity and responsibility this kind of behavior is appalling america football fans must be very disappointed todaynanit a little early to point out human error that and the minister for transport resigning before any notable investigation was concluded raises a lot of questions then again it is election timein the era of automation human error should even be a possibilitywell humans invented trains so yeahafter visiting the site mr mitsotakis said everything pointed to a tragic human error ie let make shit up news website then takes that bullshit and makes a severely misleading headline out of ithuman error more like errornanshe just gon na keep getting pregnant to avoid jail lolshe obviously a psychopath the real question is what is the deal with the guy who married her and fathered her children after the theranos scam had come to light i want to hear his takeshe has used and scammed so many people including her second childit a uterus not a get out of jail free cardit s so sad knowing that she s obviously doing this to try and her prison time she needs to just grow up and take accountability and imagine being on of her children and realizing this once you get older smhare these kids hers or did she just slap a theranos label on themi can t believe anyone had one let alone two kids with heri think she asked the judge to consider her pregnancy when he chose the date her sentence would start my recollection was that the judge quoted the 1997 supreme court case of versus and set a firm date to initiate incarcerationthe first baby didn t get her sympathy in the trial so get knocked up to try and avoid reporting to prison too bad she tried to flee the country last year how stupid do you need to be to buy a 1 way ticket to mexicoshe volunteers with a rape crisis and counseling organization the court filing read who the fuck thought it was a good idea for this psychopathic egotistical nutball to work with women in crisisshe lied to make money and is going to jail i wish more people who have lied to make money end up going to jailshe takes no accountability and culpability from her actions and probably her children won t either being raised with a mother like herwelcome second child to your forced incarcerationseems like she had babies close together in an effort to stay out of prisonthey make incarcerated women give birth in jail all the time it baffles me how this is actually workingwhy should she get a delayed prison term countless women give birth in and have the child taken from them almost immediately disgusting what power and wealth can dodo what they do to every other woman in prison that has take them away and give custody to the family or the partner or make the kids a ward of the state and send her ass to prison i fucking hate that wealthy people get special privileges in our justice systemthis woman is truly a sociopath the cruelty of bringing a child into the world knowing you are going to be missing the most important years of their life and i assume not out of love but as a prop to delay rightful punishment for her crimes what a giant pos she isevery fiber of this woman s being is tied to doing something nefarious scamming people out of money forcing employees to lie hooking up with gullible rich guys who can fund her nefarious activities using her own bloodline to prevent jail time there s not a thread of goodness in this woman she truly is a monsterwhat a horrible human beingwhats that italian movie where they keep having kids to keep sophia loren out of debtors prisoni swear to god if she gets pregnant again in an attempt to delay sentencingms holmes has deep ties to the community she is the mother of two very young children she has close relationships with family and friends many of

a mother on top of inheriting her mother s eyeswhy would anyone want to have a kid with her lolhonestly just jail her regardless pregnant women are in jail all the time she should be treated any differentlyhaving a child isn t a valid excuse to avoid jail time it s justification to get child services involved because the parents apparently are horrible decision makers who have little to no regard for the wellbeing of their childrenshe has close relationships with family and friends this statement is insane 1 does she think all people who go to jail are friendless 2 i highly doubt she got a real friendship in the world she seems like a complete sociopathfuck her holmes is a sociopath and her company theranos likely killed people with their medical tech she knew didn t workusing babies as slammer doorstopsfor those wondering how a wealthy white woman was actually sentenced to jail for mainly scanning average customers it s because of the fact that she scammed her investors who were they you ask oh just the murdochs giant media empire family the waltons family and former state department heads including henry kissinger as soon as i read that those were her investors who were scammed out of millions of dollars it no longer became if but when she would be jailed you can defraud the regular person all you want and no one will care you defraud high level investors like them you get to find out that you never fuck with the money on a side note those of you wondering if trump is going to jail only needs to read if he screwed with people on that level which so far no concrete evidence has come out yetthe psychopath she is she is 100 using those kids to avoid jaili pretty sure they send regular poor not famous women to jail pregnant just pregnant just had a baby my

normal women have babies in prison every single day what a jokefuck her and her baby excusei just read a story about a 93year old women who was tossed in jail for not paying rent at her old folks home why the fuck should this fraudster get spared jail after defrauding investors for hundreds of millions of dollarsi guarantee you she had the 2nd child in order to stand before the judge pregnant and thus get a lighter sentence and it worked fucking disgustingwhy is a child keeping her out when there are tons of women in prison with kidsto know you are definitely going to prison and get pregnant with another child is sociopathic it shows what a narcissist she is save those kids and put her in prison tomorrow what a belizabeth holmes welcomes second child because she faces prison term there

like the last time rinse repeati feel bad for her kids she having them to try to keep herself out of jail not out of any true desire for children those kids are gon na grow up with a mother who does

bitthere are thousands of incarcerated women who give birth handcuffed to bedsoh the irony the former tech woman empowerment guru now uses the most traditional way of criminal women to avoid punishment that what two pirate women did back in the 18th century back then it was called the bellyi remember hearing that other convicted female felons that where pregnant still got hauled to jail and just gave birth there it does not apply to herscrewed her children over toosend this bitch to she married into wealth had two children to avoid answering for her actions and tried to pawn off as much of the blame on her partner as she could time for miss crazy pants to do some timethere are plenty of women with who are pregnant and have children in jail sometimes for very minor offenses sometimes not even convicted just awaiting trial some have given birth handcuffed to a bed meanwhile this convicted and sentenced felon is living in a a month estate before she sent to a minimum security prison with no fences described as heaven compared to other prisons and she had two kids since being indicted despite edging on 40 knowing full well she guilty of everything our justice system is such a joke if you have the money to manipulate itshe chose to have both children at a time she was facing serious charges her selfishness continues there are many women who are mothers or are pregnant who are sent to prison every day holmes should be there nowmother of the year has kids knowing they ll grow up without her they re probably better offi hope she does get it because she was not a rich white women she would have had to give birth chained to the hospital bed i am not saying that women should be giving birth chained to a bed i am glad this was a federal case because she has to at least yearsi looked up this billy evans guy and he much better looking than i am i struggled for years and years and years to get a date in my life well into my thirties despite having a good salary and background but i like to think even at my most desperate i would never succumb to fathering children with a criminal like elizabeth holmes and by the timeline evans knew full well the things she did long before conceiving the first child with her and now presumably a secondmeanwhile pregnant women in prison for less are medically neglected and abused smh let her have the baby in jailwhat about all the people who made medically unsound decisions based on thus scumbags fraudshe went to trial and still got sentence shorter than guideline her skin and being a mom helps so she

the show 8 is enoughnangovernor reeves what are you doing about the water crisis in jackson look i busy okayare these the kinds of people who would lose their minds if the government tried to tell them how to raise their kidsfrom the same state that banned abortions comes decisions made by people educated by the worst system in the usoh look the state with the highest child mortality rate is doing dumb shit with respect to children s healthcaredoes mississippi have anything more important to be working on last i checked it like at the bottom of every state ranking list for every categoryserious question what exactly is transgender healthcaremississippi has healthcaretate reeves is a fucking clown almost everything he has done for this state has been against the interest of the people no matter their political stance i had met and talked him at a newly opened restaurant once and aside from his startlingly short stature he genuinely does seem like he has any idea how politics work and that actions have consequences that hurt people i genuinely have no idea how he got electedbecause making sure your constituents have clean drinking water is not as important gop is leading by not leading fantastic redhatsthis piece of shit schemed with brett favre to steal millions of dollars from the poorest people in the us to build a volleyball stadium he s a stupid racist fat bill gates lookalike that deserves to be in prisoni wonder if this means they ll stop doing assignment surgery on intersex babieswho the fuck wants more kids to kill themselvesimagine if democrats signed a bill that banned guns kept in homes with kids people would melt while their kids led safer lives it s odd what is and isn t important for kids 1 cause for child death nah not our problem these transgender people though a whopping 1 of the entire population they re the problemi can not imagine dedicating so much time resources and hatred towards a single minority group that makes up less than 1 of the population there s absolutely no reason for these hateful and authoritarian lawsyour daily not so friendly reminder that this fuckface and others like him are once again harming an already dangerously marginalized community gender affirming surgeries which never happen to minors actually has only a 1 regret rate https that is better than just about any surgery out there heart surgery hip surgery any sort of plastic surgery all of them have higher regret rates than gender affirming surgery the sorts of treatment that minors do get are things like puberty blockers which are completely reversible and just letting them live their fucking lives without crawling down their throats and calling them monsters that what this asshole is blocking and whether because he dangerously incompetent or maliciously evil does matter fuck him and everyone that supports this boogeyman bullshitthe party of small government ladies and gentlemen passing endless laws designed to circumvent you and your doctor decisions making over your reproductive organs why are they so gross and preoccupied with folks bodies like this bunch of creeps and pedosis this the small government government the gop talk about coming into your minor child s doctors office and deciding what s appropriate medical care for your minor childfor a political party bitching about big government they surely know how to big not in their sociopolitical realmthat s an oddly worded title the article says he wants to ban surgery and hormone treatments for children also doesn t want public funding for it eithernow i know that people will hate this but i think that minors should be able to make such a major decision for themselves people change a bunch as they get older especially in ages leading up to 25 and they may regret it not that i saying that all of them will but some i would go as far as banning all care but surgeries are a huge deal and i do know if a child can make such a decisioni a fairly liberal guy but in this case i see the argument from the conservative side at issue here is whether a minor has the necessary maturity to decide on issues involving gender transition and the need to protect minors against parents having undue influence on decisions involving gender transition let have a show of hands who supports age of consent laws who thinks a minor should not be able to legally get a tattoo hopefully everyone who raised their hand will recognize a ban on minors receiving gender transition therapy is consistent with their reasoning on the other two questionsthe cruelty is the point the ignorance is the toolafter there are no more transgender people in mississippi which group are the republicans going to marginalize and blame for the terrible infrastructure dogshit education crime and povertyas a liberal what is considered transgender healthcare if it s transitioning and hormone replacement then yes i can t get a tattoo until i m 18 my frontal line isn t fully developed then no i should be able to decide to do reassignment surgeries there are biological reasons why some things are barred behind age gates not being a bigot am completely open to discussionsyou re sitting there thinking you re not they just haven t gotten to you yeti am so freaking glad that i moved out of that shit state now i just need to change my state of residency with

become the worst state in the usa by an even larger margin great job guyswhat a ghoulish sack of shitwhenever these divorce types get to running their mouths i always think of mississippi that cess pool would collapse within a month following theunder their justification all cosmetic surgery should also be included but i bet they won t see it that way because they want to groom their daughters for marriagethe idea that you can ban healthcare is so upsettingit s just morally wrong to ban a form of healthcare for political reasonsthese fly over states really want to make sure people keep flying overfucking sadists what is it with trumplikkans and their obsession with other people sexualityand just like that mississippi is no longer the poorest state ninth union amirite fun fact life expectancy in mexico is three years longer than in mississippihe should do himself a favor and ban minor haircuts for adultsi wanted to ask if mississippi is using the same rule book as the taliban but remembered mississippi does like booksthey been doing a lot of trying to kill people lately trying to push kids to suicide trying to prevent pregnant women from receiving emergency healthcare

legislatures to promote hate rhetorical question i know the answerparty of small government rightyet another reason to never go to spend money in or associate with any business in mississippi the party of don t tell me how to raise my kids is telling parents how to raise their cause ya know gawd and all actually it s about power and don t kid yourselves democrats attack these assholes with facts and reality but make it real make it hit home to people don t challenge their hypocrisy that s what they want challenge them on what they haven t succeeded in doing improving health care in general improving standards of living improving the economy improving the state they re entrusted with improving hit them on the stuff they should be doing but won t because it runs contrary to their core beliefs of we and they but make it real not conceptual don t engage in the culture war engage in real and measurable subjects go for the throat and don t let up on your messaging beat the damned drum so loud and often that the republican responses on culture war look as pathetic as they actually are why haven t you improved health care governor because of gays wtf governor why do we have the highest infant mortality in the country governor because of transsexuals wtf governor and so on hit the issues that hit people in their own homes don t talk economics talk take home pay don t talk insurance talk how much it will cost if you have an health emergency make this stuff real then the culture war bullshit becomes secondary to how much juniors new eyeglasses are going to cost me

screeching about and open our borders to refugees who want to escape the red states i sick of these inbred bigot hillbillies dragging us down into the muck with them and then begging us for aid to rebuild their trailer parks after a tornado since they spent all their money on walls burning black history books and building trans death campsremovedi sure how i being downvoted you guys not watch the show i am jazzremovedremovednanwomen all through the ages have had to fight to get equal rights the biggest obstacle seems to be religion all the western religions christianity islam judaism say the woman is a helper to man the man is the leader a woman committed the first sin and got humanity kicked out of the garden of eden for that she was cursed to have trouble during childbirth islam being the newest and youngest religion seems to be the furthest behind in recognizing that women are god creation as much as men and should be treated as suchcould only someone in power or authority make this happennanare these derailments happening suddenly more frequently or are they just suddenly getting more coverage because it s the flavor of the monththose who follow trains because they work for a railroad or are a railfan know that serious derailments happen literally every single day every since palestine these will rightfully be brought into the open railroad greed and mistreatment of their employees is legendary regardless of your politics because it s not you need to vocally stand with the rail working women and men and their safety f the railroad greed let s wait h til tomorrow s derailmentonly a fraction of the railroad system is in passenger rated condition perhaps this is the level ought to be the standard for transporting hazardous freight and added crew members as well in that caseso i ship hazmat material by rail all the time with pretty much every major rail carrier there are derailments daily given most of these are minor most times the cars do spill or break they just skid off the trackhank hill has entered the chatone car 30k gallons is one rail carso a single railcar ofis there an increase in derailments or are we just hearing about them more oftenthey should never have laid off denzel in unstoppable he doesn t put up with this shitshe do like she do like she do like propanewhat a weird article the standard tank car for propane holds that that much so this is a derailment of one car that didn t even breach media is going to get sick of covering these because they happen everytaste the meat not the heatderail does not equal spillno people are just paying more attention now chemical spills from trucks are probably even more frequent we just don t hear about itstatistics show that 3 train derailments happen a day in the united states you do hear about them because they are all that bad you do hear about the hazardous ones it takes a lot to puncture those tankershank hill is gon na have an aneurismderailments are probably something that can never be reduced to zero i guess that obvious it not just the cars that are variables in need of maintenance but the tracks themselves can drift out of alignment and we are talking about fractions of an inch that can make a difference i used to work for a railroad in the signal department which was responsible for the sorts of equipment that detects when an axle is overheating like was involved in this crash something i find myself wondering about now that we have determined that the crew got a warning about the overheating axle just before the derailment is if the derailment had something to do with trying to suddenly stop the train in response to the warning i am not trying to imply human error here these trains are ridiculously long and the car brakes are triggered one after the other my point after saying that derailments are something we can never get down to zero would be to question why hazardous material like vinyl chloride was being moved along on a train with so many cars at such a high speed it would seem that hazardous materials should require special treatment like slower speeds and shorter trains with less carsyou see it spills evenly and at a fraction of the cost of natural gas hank hillimportant to distinguish though that derailment does not equal catastrophic explosion every time a single truck or wheelset coming off the tracks is a derailment they do tip over and crash every time still we need a regulated nationalized network because corporate greed will make things worse and worse and worseso since the dawn of time trains have derailed constantly and all of a sudden now we just going to post about every single onepeople please stop with putting your pennies on the tracks this is really getting outta handthat s sounds like a lot but it s about one rail cartrump deregulated this industry and prevented train companies from being required to get new braking systemssomeone get hank hill on the lineso people have been saying the ohio derailment had nothing to do with trump rolling back the new brake rule because it dealt with oil gas well conservatives where are the goal posts gon na be moved now cause propane is gas just a different type of fueland propane accessoriessomething something hank hillsomebody call hank hilldecades of ignoring infrastructure and cutting back safety regulationsmontana wants to sue oregon and washington for refusing to let them port oil through us they also refuse to share any of the financial responsibility if something goes to shit awwwww poor landlocked red state need the little blue city kids to open the gate for you eat shithank hill must never know of thiswere there any propane accessorieshank hill is screaming bwahhh somewhere right now in texasthree cheers for deregulation eh rightwingersis this the train version of russian windows and stairsnews has a real train derailment fixation these dayshow much of the biden infrastructure plan goes towards fixing railroadsyou think rail companies would be better at rails by noware we going to blow this one up toojust came here for the hank hill commentsyou get a derailment you get a derailment everyone gets a derailmenthank hill somewhere having a strokehank hill is devastatedget hank hill on the phone status could your trains not derail with dangerous for five minuteshank hill breathing intensifieshank hill is gon na have a freaking conniptioni m starting to think this happens more than we know or someone is sabotaging the railroad this has happened in the last few months in ohio texas and now florida with ohio s accident getting the most attentionoh no please tell me it was also carrying propane accessoriesmaybe that dipshit governor can send the mouse to clean it uppoisoned local desantis supporters were heard saying deregulate me more daddyget your railways under control americahank hill is having a panic attackgallons that one train carremember when railroad workers strike for better working conditions and safety remember how their main complaint was that the infrastructure was too old and that they wanted more safety glad our left leaning president threatened the livelihood of every railroad worker to force them to stop strikingwe gon na light this one on fire toohow long till they want a federal bailouthank hill is gon na be pissedhmm its almost like if the us had proper infrastructure funding and a 45th president who did rollback train regulations this would have likely happened would ithank hill is gon na be devastated i tell you hwhatin hank hill voicehmm something is probably being rammed through congress or repealed by sctous suddenly trains derailing is the new groovenobody tell hank hillgallons is only a couple tank cars dependent on how it was loaded i work at the railroad and that happens all the time the important part is how much actually got out of the carhank hill in shamblesany propane accessoriesthat a clean burning hell i tell you whathank hill httpsfyi the reason why the national media does cover derailments aside from the fact that large corporations protect their own class warfare and they do want news that ca be made into a partisan issue or wedge issue which is also a part of class warfare is that they happen all of the fucking time and if good little consumers knew the horrible truth they would be less good little consumers what with all of the existential dread and terrorsomewhere in an alternate universe there s a hank hill crying remorsefullythey must be a common occurrence that s getting more attentionavoidable accidents had railroad company did proper maintenance on rails and trains but profit come first safety is secondin tallahassee next to the capital oh that would be grandgood thing desantis is going to ban gas stovesdesantis will certainly want to light this one on fire to minimize the damagein florida oh no anywaytime to blame the gay guy and biden againwho was it again that deregulated this industryand propane accessorieshas hank hill been notifiedhow hard is it to not derail more rerailing less derailingthis is a risk that comes with voting for republicans who gut or reduce safety regulationsis this the 3rd world country shit hole that trump was talking about my 5 year old does a better job at keeping trains on their tracksobamaaaa err i mean bideeeen why were you there to stop the train with your hands outstretched now think of the childrennot big enough florida is a big state need more propane to break the state off from the mainland so it can float awayhere comes florida man running to the federal government for helphank hill moved to floridamouse in overalls observed at the scene wanted for questioning last seen driving toward orlando with female mouse thought to go by the name minnieand it did change the smell of the neighborhood one bitit must have been crt things republicans saynationalize the railway for the safety of americanscan thank trump for deregulating safety cuz it cuts into profits on the upside he might showup to give you stale old waterwe ve been doing trains long enough to have it figured out by now this is ridiculousthat one rail car worth of propane one car that all not great it not as big as the headline would make it appearso what the real deal about brakes on trains that are old and outdated is it all trains how can we know which trains have up to date reliable brakes vs a let me pray before this train takes off brakeswhat are those rails made out of in your country woodthe track was too woke for the trainme living in 3rd world country rarely heard local train accident in past years other than some passenger trains delay or natural disasters rail cut off meanwhile in 1st world us really againhank hill is furious right nowbut was it also carrying propane accessoriesboy i tell you hwhat sorry could resistmeanwhile desantis cooks up a do say derailment bill that would leave any offender that mentions this in public open to in fines if mentioned in the same sentence as desantis that fine doubles to additionally he notes any train that is derailed in such a way that it makes me ron desantis look bad will be labeled a democrat and as such it will be subject to immediate shunning and catastrophic disassemblywow outdated and rarely updated system is failing nah could be in americajust florida who careshow will desantis blame this on the gays or the african american or disneythis is god knocking on all the red states doors with these chemical disastersusa usa let get that bullet train built right awayanother outrage accident stop giving us such bad news you repugs had engineered horror to happenat least it happened in florida take that ronanyone think it has to do with them being swing statesits just florida nothing of value will be harmed edit downvote all you want it wo change the fact that the fascist state of florida is a wasteland and should be exiled from the usif your next to a train track do these guys ever check the equipmentgood job trump got rid of all those regulations regarding safety checks etc but i m sure it s the lefts faultin the freedom state on the florida fuhrer s watch must be biden s fault or the gays because they said a word out louddoesn t one of those tanks hold like gallonsnani can only admire the girl and her fathers bravery whilst being appalled once again by the barbarism of the russian statedaughter is smarter than her eldersman arrested and daughter sent to orphanage fuck the midget putin and hope he fall off hotel window while enjoying a good polonium teauntil the people rise up and put an end to this these sorts of stories will be commonterrible and if you think this can never happen here in the you re fooling yourselfthe florida of the eastnanit should be noted these are ford vans not the ones previously announced from oshkoshnow where can i pick me up a grumman llv with 700k miles on iti wonder how they will be distributedmy mailman in his grumman would park in my lot and have his lunch every day for about a half hour and every day he would leave and there would be a whole puddle of oil where he was parked someone was surely dumping at least a quart of oil into that thing every single day this went on for at least a year they finally just gave him a new van about a month ago and i so happy for himhmm i guess the mpg llv lawsuit made them change their minds httpssurprised dejoy allowed itthis is awesome especially after last year when they announced they were going to upgrade to gas powered vehicles that averaged mpg 16 states sued the usps over that decision and this is the result change happens just have to fight for iti think this is a good way to get the charging station infrastructure built power a lot of it with renewable as much as possiblethey will probably get lost in transitumm why more charging stations than evsthey need some big bumpers every llv i see looks like it s been in a crash up derbyplease give some to my town so my dogs can t hear the truck coming and goingcool cool so when is useless garland gon na do his job and indict dejoy it been over 2 yearsthis is good in theory but not so great in practice coming from an ex amazon delivery driver using both petrol and electric vans everyone hated getting assigned an electric van because more often than not the battery would die mid route this meant you would be either stuck waiting in a supermarket car park for it to charge over several hours or you had a petrol van show up anyway to finish your shift whilst you sit waiting for it to charge enough to get you back to depot i all for moving off petrol but it just not very practical yet for delivering of course american reddit strikes again why am i not surprised only place facts get downvoted because it does agree with your own views lollet me get an old llv it ll be my daily driveronly a matter of time until charging stations are as prevalent as gas stations and people can stop complaining about well what if you run outta juice you screwedmail will still be a month latedid they give up on their plan of buying gas powered vehicles that came out last year httpswhy are we buying more than one charger per vehicle these are route vans than should return to the same post office every night to charge i don t see the point in additional chargersmy mail truck ca even go over 55 mphall left hand drive makes no sensewhy does the post office even still exist they are incompetent and disgruntled at their job and lord knows that the service is terrible if it was not for amazon giving them a contract they would of died years ago as they very well shouldguess i not getting my mail when the power goes outthey also buying one gas vehicle for every ev committing to continue to buy gas vehicles for another few years the new gas vehicles will be polluting for decades this seems like it should have been part of the headlinenanwait there are people out there that take accountability for thingsjesus as an american i do know how to deal with all the accountability shown in this tragedy so farthey should have just blamed bidensetting a good example for milker pete buttigieghmmm lots of these happening around the same time latelynannot sure how greece works but i wager that man is being screened for drugs that have even been dreamed of yeti m sorry how do two trains crash is greece that far behind on railway technology is there a cartoon coyote running around flipping track levers it s 2023 all of these systems should be computerized and trains should have collision warning systemsa man who was trying to ascertain the fate of his daughter who was on the train said he had a harrowing phone conversation with her before she was cut off she told me we re on fire my hair is burning he told ert without giving his name okay so was she okay why would you just leave it at thatwait why is the government responding to a train derailment that s clearly an internal corporate matter that ll be taken care of by the free marketnanit fun reading the article then reading the commentsit s entirely possible we ll never know for sure because if covid did leak from a lab china destroyed the evidence a long time ago and disappeared everyone involvedaccording to the actual article there still no consensus among experts as to the origin can we stop relying on headlines for the entire storymy opinion too much of an effort on china part to pin it to that open animal market all the while steering from the huge bio top level security lab in same town im just a old rn with interest in anything science my only hesitation was jumping in with the red right screaming re the lab but personally i highly questioned the close proximity of the virus outbreak the high security lab doing on this very virus in the same city plus how very early on china was attempting to silence doctors etc controling the whole transmission story rumors scared me before the story got much traction once it was out of china i knew it was gon na be a very bad thingand just like that republicans believe the fbiis there a mandela effect going on because i definitely remember being told that it was possible someone leaked it from a lab through their shoes or clothes and when they visited the wet market it spread from there i remember seeing a map that showed the distance from the lab to the wet market what was the other theory i don t think it was a virus to kill people or anything just that it was being studied and somehow leaked due to someone messing up safety protocols or something an accidentwere people being banned on social media for saying this was possiblerip the millions dead from hopefully we can discover its origins and prevent another such horrific pandemica corona virus originating from the city where the only lvl 4 biolab in china is same lab that was ridiculed by auditors for being unsafe same lab that published work on viruses same lab that was doing gain of function research on said viruses nah probably a conspiracy theoryi wonder what evidence the fbi director is basing this on besides the fact that it makes china look bad to say thiswell it seems that not all agency heads low confidence in lab leak httpsone of the saddest lessons of history is this if we ve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle we re no longer interested in finding out the truth the bamboozle has captured us it s simply too painful to acknowledge even to ourselves that we ve been taken once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it carl sagan2 years ago even mentioning this possibility was considered fringe right wing science denying xenophobic tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy drivel fucking ridiculous how the whole covid thing was spun and now look at this headline absolute horseshit the way some people were lambastedso we all died and they all lied this pisses me off a bit more than i expected it would we all lost stuff the world ground to a halt and medications that at least two ppl in my house rely on can t be found anywhere all because of lies they gon na do anything about that nopeoh i thought that was just a fringe conspiracy theoryi sure we get to the bottom of it as soon as china cooperates with the investigation have you tried to subpoena any of the communist party members or any scientists or other witnesses that were left alive can we make sure to separate this probable mundane theory from the theories implicating fauci bill gates and all democrats in a global conspiracy with communist china to unleash a man made bioweapon upon the entire world in order to steal our freedoms force us to wear masks inject us with microscopic computer chips and kill us all56 replies in and already an overload of sarcastic snark never change redditi said this before and got downvoted to hellheadline china did it article experts disagree and no one really knowsfour other agencies still say they think it s natural and came from the wild for what it is worthdamn i am so tired of this what is the evidence people keep saying x said this y said that what evidence is christopher wray basing his analysis on can somebody link the fbi report as i am unable to find anything except some random dude who seems to have no expertise in virology or epidemiology saying that the outbreak started in a lab lets say the first case was a lab member did they get ill collecting samples were they doing anything to enhance the virus in the lab if not then why does it even matter if it started in a labwhat so republicans that got torn to pieces for saying this years ago were right wowhe but there is no new evidence or proof so political statement onlybirx saying trump killed hundreds of thousands with his lies denialism and forcing americans visiting china back into the country untested is what should be as most likelymost likely this is an attempt to drum up support for a conflict against chinai looked at the genome data myself the gc content is quite homegenous which suggests a natural origin if you edit genes in the you would usually use a standard codon usage of ecoli that would lead to a shift in gc in the regions that have been edited so the only way this could be out of a lab would be it was cultivated from a natural sample and some infected themselves by accident but that again would mean it had been out there already so i do see that and think the fbi does not know what they are talking about and should focus domestic issues like paramilitaries in weird shirts and dumb faces plotting coupsi ca believe we having another sadaam has wmds level of intelligence failure again in my lifetimethe lab leak theorists taking a victory lap are dumbasses there absolutely no new evidence presented in this article and many other government agencies still disagree with wray statements it was never about proof for the people who seized on this theory and refuse to let gois he gon na get banned from the internet now or are we past thatwhen do the apologies startthe fbi are not scientists are not viral experts and it stupidly irresponsible for them to weigh in on this there is zero evidence of a lab leak origin and quite a bit of evidence against itso are we transitioning to the oh of course it was x everybody knew that stage of the conspiracy theory life cycledeletedagain not a scientist therefore merely opinionwell it sure seems like china might be supporting russian war not sure what would make me be suspicious of just can t quite put my fingers onanyone with a brain already knew thisyes the evidence has been clear for some time conducting gain of function research on dangerous viruses at a lower bio security level than necessary not such a great ideafunny how the same people who reject climate change science when more than 95 of climate scientists are in agreement about anthropogenic climate change are the same people who fully endorse the lab leak theory on admittedly weak evidence and a lack of consensusit almost like everyone dismissed as conspiracy theorists were absolutely rightit should be noted that even if there was a lab leak it does mean covid was engineered i listen to the opinions of those in science over speculations of government agents that have no education in this particular field of study from two years ago https httpsis the fbi supposed to do domestic stufftrump was right on calling it the china virus thenexcept that this is also being reported as low confidence i not prone to believe a low confidence report that disagrees with a significant body of reporting that concludes otherwiseamusing 1 wray does give any evidence just his conclusions most likely leaves a fair amount of political wriggle room just in case someone elses evidence is irrefutable i guess 2 after all this time telling me not to trust government experts the magical thinkers over on the right are more than happy to be told their opinion by wray expertise oh well it does confirm what i think about them of coursefor anyone pretending this is some sort if this is literally the bbc reporting that wray said this in fox news the fbi has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident he told fox newsremovedwell if the fbi says it smost likely a potential lab incident how bout you stfu until you actually know somethingi still do know why this keeps getting brought up this was disproved years ago by oh actual scientist who know their shit i really do care that it the fbi chief saying this he and literally everyone around him do know viruses they do have that knowledge set what more important is that actual scientists have disproved the hypothesis either the fbi decided to accept science or not at that time any time the fact that the question still exists a fbi chief is brining it up and calls it likely shows that they are ignoring the scientists who literally know best that their failure and they should feel bad about iti was pretty on weather covid was a leak or just random evolution in the wild now that the fbi has said it a leak i am 100 certain that it a natural virusthe crazies spit out 50 conspiracies a month one happens to be possibly true the crazies see our unverified unsupported horseshit we spew out of our mouths is now validdid wray investigate kavanaugh what i mean by investigate is to do nothing but play politics until someone severely compromised is on the supreme court he did trump bidding fairly well there but we should trust him now most likely with low confidenceput aside the hilarious market theories it was always an absurdish notion that lived on a powerball pct of actually happening why wet market in wuhan any other wet market in southeast asia or a for that matter there simply was no conceivable reason to explain it beyond pure 1 in 10 billion chance but far more importantly the president of the united states of america https already stated that us intel believed it was a lab leak back in 2020 the secretary of state https said the same and along others from the senate intelligence committee who had been briefed why because us intel had already determined patient 0 was a wuhan lab worker https in of 2019 this has been the position of the us intel since the beginning the only significant people in the us govt to dispute it were fauci nih members and it was of course revealed over time that nih and fauci were directly involved with funding for the wuhan lab which at the very least should have forced them to professionally absolve themselves and disclose a massive conflict of interest in the mattermost likely a potential mr wray said in comments to fox news on tuesday have we forgotten how to interpret the english language all of a suddenfox needed something old to distract from all the dominion stuffi thought that was an insane conspiracy theory and anyone purporting it needs to be banned from all platforms for misinformationfeel like this ship has sailed and it does really matter unless you can prove it beyond a reasonable doubtthat not the same thing as certain furthermore people are reading way too much into this and i like to see the evidence they basing their decision off of before either supporting or rejecting this conclusionthis is totally duh territory everyone that wanted to know knew this years ago my question is why are the authorities suddenly revisiting this and acting like it is newsso in the end the obvious answer was the right onegenuine if it was a lab leak so what what changes what can be done a lot of people are saying we told you so but this whole thing is still unproven two years later and there was never any conclusive evidence presented in the first place i mean great so maybe it was a lab leak after all but so fucking what is someone going to go to jail will gain of function research into viruses get banned if course not nothing changes this is another useless distractionis it wild this story is all over the news the same week it comes out that fox was knowingly pushing a lie to fuel the insurrection and mccarthy just gave fox all the jan 6 footagei guess everyone has already forgotten about the balloondeletedevery pandemic in history and has been natural but we re convinced this one isn i ll need some extraordinary evidence for this extraordinary claimus department of energy said it had found the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in wuhan but could only reach that conclusion with low confidence they have low confidence about the most likely conclusion they might as well say we are highly confident that we have any fucking ideacan we collectively sue the shit out of these scumsthis idea has been suppressed on social media for so long i hope the ideologues take a good hard look at there actions being able to question the narrative that you are told is a fundamental principle of western civilisationit is possible however it a bit too timely resurrecting this now as relations with china are degrading to take the accusation seriouslyfor anyone beliving religiously that it was not a leak and brands everyone who sees some truth or possibility in a lab leak as a crazy isolated nazi conspiracy theorist by the way there is a sars lab in wuhan and the house foreign affairs committee chairman michael mccaul reached the same conclusion on it being a lab leak https explain to me then why china is refusing to let who investigate the origin of the virus if there was nothing to cover up and the evidence was overwhelming of it not being a lab leak i would like to see it because this scientic consesus of researchers regarding it not being a leak have not even been allowed in china https or received any whatsoever data from china https fauci went from calling the lableak a conspriacy theory https to that all possibilities are open https and china is probably hiding something https amp now when 2 out of 6 government agencies have reached the conclusion of it being a lab leak we are finally at a open debate https which i welcomei like how america is bringing this up again after the balloonsnanyeah no chance anyone will ever find a way around such an

6 years this seems insanely cheap for someone who likely has to fly around fairly often the audit alone will likely cost more in resources to perform in this instancei feel like this will reverse uno and end up showing elaine chao abused the usage of govt jets i look forward to this result lol future contenta government watchdog will audit transportation secretary pete buttigieg use of government airplanes for some trips as part of a broad review dating back to 2017 the transportation department office of inspector general oig will review 18 flights buttigieg made on federal aviation faa planes on seven total trips after a request by republican senator marco rubio the costs of the flights for buttigieg and staff was and in six of seven trips costs to fly on faa planes were less expensive than flying commercial marco rubio is such a dork weird how they did say shit about all of the expensive frequent and fraudulent flights the trump admin took guess they also assume that pete would behave like a criminal and cheat like they themselves dothe costs of the flights for buttigieg and staff was this investigation is going to cost more than thisis this going to be a repeat of when fox news made a stink https over buttigieg bringing his husband along on a government trip even though basically all previous secretaries and everyone else on the trip also brought spouses with themwe worried about 42k how about someone go audit all those ppp loans under trumpit s like 2k to fly my family of 4 to the east coast for a wedding he probabaly has more than 3 staffers and i am sure they fly all the time i can t be bothered with this bullshitmake a request make the request front page news implying wrong doing before the audit has even started never mention the results of the audit unless you find something no matter how minuscule profiti m sure the same people who him for not sprinting to ohio will criticize him for making an unscheduled stop in ohioanyone who works as a fed will tell you that the internal travel systems used to book airfare are operated on a city pairing list that is most of the time more expensive than just booking directly with the airline i just took a trip up to dc and it was 950 dollars vs 250 on the airline website pete is actually saving money by using a government operated vehicle to transport himself and staffers unlike the folks across the aisle projecting this alleged corruption buttigieg is stupid enough to abuse federal propertyconclusion the flights were cheaper than commercialgood if he did something wrong take action see how easy that is conservativesalternative title senator rubio uses us audit agency to cast doubt on buttigieg fitness for officecan someone be the responsible journalist and ask rubio what his concern is here and why he wouldn t request similar information for 4 years while trump flew around the world to play golf from https days trump has spent at mar a lago 127 cost of flights to mar a lago 31 so far days trump has spent at bedminster 86 cost of flights to bedminster 27 so far trump has visited his clubs once every this many days since his inauguration projected visits to golf clubs in four years 296 projected visits in eight years 592 total times obama played golf during his eight year presidency 306where was the watchdog for them ppp loansrubio is a fucking moron lmaorubio requested the audit as a distraction rubio demanded buttigieg resign due to the ohio derailment buttigieg pointed out that the last time he heard from rubio it was in a letter rubio sent him requesting the dot to ease safety regulations on trains pretty sad really a politician deciding to weaponize the ig because they got caught doing something that they want to not be knownthey are basically trying to benghazi him keep doing investigations and talk about how horrible he is so that he can t win the presidency in the futurethe clowns are at it again wasting everyone s time and money but they didn t audit the last epa person to compare usage so it won t mean anything anywaythis is just an extension of when they lost their mind over his husband coming on a goodwill trip ignoring all of the thousands of trips spouses made before him for some reason hard to put your finger on itfucking little marco rubiopart of a broad review dating back to this headline is misleadingthey gon na get manchin too while they at itthey investigating 40k the lawyers will cost that on the first dayboebert claimed she spent for 7 months of campaigning and reimbursed herself from campaign funds in a state district not the entire ushe took 7 private jet trips for 42k they should audit him and ask him how he got such a cheap pricerubio requested the review in december after fox news reported on the flights and asked if any violations of transportation department policy were the stupid ass republican sheep will never bail on their fox new overlord even as we are learning with sworn testimony that fox news has no moral compass and fabricates lies to keep their moron viewers riled up it s an embarrassment that rubio still considers anything that comes from them as accurate as rupert murdoch has recently said they will make shit up for the financials benefit of keeping viewerswatch your back pete next they want to follow u home check that you sorting your whites colors correctlyand pete loved the idea to show he used it when it would save tax payer money otherwise would fly commercialwell the gays do love to traveleven for an empty hairdo rubio still comes off as lazyi love it republicans we want you to investigate secretary pete he s mean to us hopefully we ll catch him abusing government resources ig ok i ll do that but for the sake of being thorough i ll use 2017 thru 2020 as a baseline to determine if what pete is doing is out of republicans internally wait not like thatthey see pete as a threat and they are trying to cut him off he very popular with moderates of both parties and independent voters which is a rare thing these dayshow about those billions kushner received from saudi arabiaso an independent auditor will make sure government funds are being used properly i didn t have an issue with it when trump was president i don t have an issue with it now i won t in the next administration eitherrubio requested the review in december after fox news reported on the flights and asked if any violations of transportation department policy were identified i do even think this is news by all means do the review oversight is good but unless they find something this is just partisan posturing especially since review finds sec buttigieg flights were within guidelines will never get the level of engagement that investigation launched does the most likely scenario is it just sort of implying something bad when nothing triggered the review except marco rubio asking for itconservatives are worried about buttigieg i keep seeing his name next to investigations and inquiries that seem frivolous same type of groundwork i saw laid against hillary in the early days by the time election season rolls around people remember the existence of the investigations and not the substance or outcomelet correct this butthurt traitorous republicans desperate for any win falsely accuse buttigieg of wasting taxpayer funds there that betterthis is ironic american taxpayers deserve assurances that their tax dollars are not wasted by the government highest officials rubio wrote ironically about an audit that will take up tax dollars for a and political points the article headlines are just clickbait playing into the whole thing the frustrating part is rubio gets political points now and if something is found he wins out big if it a huge waste of time and resources he may still be able to spin some part of the findings to make it look like a waste 6 out ot 7 were cheaper fox headlines buttigeg wastes money on private planes and then sites the one that was marginally more expensive but time saving or worst case for rubio he gets the political points now and nothing is found and no follow up articles are published or get any traction this is standard out of the republican playbook accuse waste money on fruitless investigations in bad faith find any part for political points or just outright lie then turn around and accuse democrats of doing the same thing when they investigate legitimately illegal actionsi m fine with long as we re comparing apples to apple for other administrations aka trips for former presidentsi read the headline and was expecting trumpian levels of spending only to find out it 46k over 6 years lol20 says rubio only read the fox news headline and not the article which reported there were only 7 jet flights when the cost was lower than commercialok cool go ahead and audit it and find nothing wrong no loss of buttigieg nothing of any importance accomplished republicans are such perpetually butthurt braindead little crybabies they do so much illegal shit they just convinced democrats have to be doing it toosounds like the gop is taking buttigieg s threat in 2024 seriouslytackling the big issues here yeah it s the flights that are running up the us debt i would like a watchdog on gop lobbyists stocks owned and them on the record on if trump lost election us is doomed one party is trying to progress the us to a civilized level while the other is playing toddler and hypocrite there needs to be an amendment to the constitution where the public can declare the whole government ineffective and they all get dropped from their and start a newit s fun and sad that the republicans seem to have run out of ideas so to draw attention away from the big fox news lawsuit and admitted extension of the republican party pr machine they have the covid lab leak disney florida oversite board change now thisthe investigation was triggered by a fox news report rubio had seen fox news is facing a multi billion dollar lawsuit for making false claims to harm others and all evidence revealed this far supports those claims this investigation should be shut down immediatelyif there misconduct then the evidence will bear this out but so far he seems to be a force for the good of all americans i think we going to see republicans attacking buttigieg more and more as he gains increased popularity his firm but calm demeanor coupled with extensive knowledge and perspective on a myriad of issues important to the current political landscape really takes the right to task when challenging and being challengedthe irony is that some republicans did think he traveled to east palestine fast enough auditing a expenditure in a trillion dollar budget is not going to make a difference in the national debt i hope they keep track of the audit costs i bet it will cost more thanohh look republicans wastingnow do the yapping yam s trips to play golflooking in from outside is

out hotel rooms and doing golf tours every weekendi don t like pete but it s not because i think he s a grifter this is obviously a shamhonestly i think the fact that they re really piling on buttigeig is because republicans are really scared of him he s very likely to be one of the strongest candidates for president post 2024 he s not my favorite by far but i wouldn t be shocked if he becomes president in 2028this is witch hunt bullshit as a preparation for the or potus election one trip to mar lago costs more than buttigieg entirely term so farsee republicans lost their shit and

as some kind of gotcha but sec buttigieg does play those kinds of games he put them in their place real quick this is what republicans do they throw a lot of shit at the wall hoping that it sticks they also hoping that good or bad this sticks around for a bit and everyone will move on red meat for the base to make it look like they doing anything other than trying to run a country because republicans do know how to do that anymore no ideas no policies no solutions just dumb fuck outrage concern about bullshitwhy do conservatives hate buttigieg so muchfixed it x200b us watchdog run by republicans to audit buttigieg openly gay democrat government jet useoh look another non issues drummed up by the gop who refuses to help regarding real issuesi really hope this guy never holds public office againremovedafter a request by republican senator marco rubio so probably a whole entire nothingburger of imaginary bullshit thenthese chucklefucks so pathetici hope nothing happens just like when trump charged thousands of dollars for white house secret services at trump hotels that was an issue then rightthe right myst realy fear himit is called weaponizing governmenthe s the secretary of the department of transportation what do they not understandi fully welcome government oversight from the report this is going back to 2017 which is well before buttigieg got the gig only thing that gives me pause is that this was requested information from marco rubio so i m sure that might cause problems independent oversight is great politically motivated oversight not so muchpete only dropped the presidential run after he cut a deal to endorse biden and stab bernie in the back for a cabinet position he isn t qualified formy god the cleanest most earnest politician i ve ever seen and so of course they have to try to break him these people really need to go live a colony in antarctica with no flights in or outoooh someone feeling threatened by a public official who is actually competentthe transportation department office of inspector general oig will review 18 flights buttigieg made on federal aviation faa planes on seven total trips after a request by republican senator marco rubio yeah this sounds legitrethuglicans do know how to govern only how to punish withhold subjugate and thievelet em audit all they want they have no powerthe amount of people defending politicians is wildi hope he s doing buttigieg stuff in therelet play which lobbyist told rubio to audit the gay dudefine do it this is the difference between liberals and liberals are fine with their elected representatives and government officials being held accountable if they have done something wrongam i the only one who thinks it s strange that us cabinet members are supposed to fly economywe need an actual secretary of transportation not a nepo babyi have a friend in transportation who claims buttigieg is the worst thing to happen to america since sugarthe fact that our train and road infrastructure is unacceptable for our transportation secretary to the point where he has to fly speaks volumeswhy isn t he biking everywhereincoming redditors upset because someone they like has to deal with routine oversightbut when someone does this to elon it s creepyhis jet money from our tax payer dollars should go towards ukrainenanok seems like a classic case of suicide by incarcerationthis guy hated cops so much that not only did he kill three of them he tried to frame some more for his own death the president of the local police unionoh wow i remember this one i was surprised he survived the shootout though judging by the looks of it the fight did end therewas trying to find out why the cops were there and i finally found this article https from july that has way more info on the events leading up to the shootout there is no mention of any prior history or contact with law enforcement mentioned apparently that article is paywalled it was when i read it earlier but there is also a wikipedia page https that has been updated as wellwe ve investigated ourselves and have found no wrong doingi feel the need to ask are body cams ever expected to be on inside a holding area and if not should they be all things considered more cameras inside a lock up improves the ability to hold everyone accountable for their actionspikeville police department is can t waitis in a shootout and does off himself there but hangs himself in his must be the ol epstein suicideshocking knock me over with a featherman who killed three officers dies by suicide in a place run by people in law enforcement cameras did catch any of itwe needed cameras for transparency but nope how is one to have trustthere a new definition for suicide by copsee this is the kind of shit that shakes trust murder a citizen jail to a trial murder a cop extrajudicial execution i not shedding a tear for this guy he seems pretty evil but you ca just fucking do this shit and keep your legitimacy know who else trades a life for a life every fucking gang edit it wild i gotten more private messages over this than i gotten in the 10 years previous and no suggesting someone like a cop killer or child molester should be watched closely is not saying surveillance on every shoplifter and drink in jailweird same shit happened to epsteinif he was in russia he d have fallen out of a 12th floor windowthat photo of him after the arrest yikes not a ton of sympathy for this guy but it certainly looks like he was given a dose of vigilante justice by the arresting officersah yes pulled an epstein definitely suicide because the sheriff says soi would be shocked if he really did kill himself murdering 3 cops you going away for the rest of your life prison sucks enough i could see someone not wanting to live that waykilled three cops there was no way this wasnt gon na happen bit like putting a in a locked room with the victims parents theres no question about how bad its gon na end for the guy if anything he was marked for death the day they walked him into the jail one way or another he wasnt gon na be around much longer once they found outsids sudden inmate death syndromewhatcha bet they re hiring jeff epstein s autopsy teammost likely from natural causesdon t worry the police are investigating themselves and i m sure we ll get the totally accurate story any day nowhe had an epstein experiencelow iq cops spend all their free time watching crap shows like yellowstone mayor of kingstown etc etc etc which all glorify and rationalize police breaking any and all rules cause you know ends justify the means justice was served there the law then there what right and so on it only a matter of time before that starts spilling over into real lifei hate reading about dead police dogs because those doggos had no choice in being used as tools of violence for the statenothing to see here you just live in a police statefirst all the cameras mysteriously shut off and then he fell down like 74 times in a row damndest thingwait what the gop say that we must always believe the copsso when are the cops who murdered him going to get murder chargesi love how it just legal for cops to murder people they do like and everyone knows it but there is not much we can do about it abolish the fucking policethis man said hippity hoppity get the fuck off my property in the strongest of tonesnothing to see here folks move alonglet me guess he commited suicide by stabbing himself in the back three timesyou know people are so quick to judge like how every time an official dies in russia nowadays it supposedly has to be putin statistically all these events could just be huge coincidencenothing to see here folks let move it alongah suicide is that what we re going withthey killed him it s not even a secret at this pointhow many officers does it take to push an inmate down the stairs zero because he trippeddude ended his life with a of 3 to 1 well doneso unlucky probably heart failureremoveddude ended his life with a of 3 to 1 well donegot the epstein treatmentbro forgot the police do have policejail cell made in russiaa murderer was

flooreveryone calls china authoritarian and evil yet we have evil on our own soil we turn a blind eye todamn we lost a good one therei am ok with this he killed a police dogmhm yup this checks outhave a feeling they let some other inmates take care of it for them for a pack of cigsyou play with fire you get burnednothing suspicious to see hereat least this one i understanddeleteddeletednanfrom the story the texas department of public safety was duped into shipping at least texas driver s licenses to a chinese organized crime group that targeted asian texans dps director steve mccraw told a texas house committee on monday the crime organization which mccraw did not name was able to get its hands on the texas driver s licenses by first pulling personal data on individuals with asian surnames from the dark web and other underground portals that info including previous addresses and family names allowed thieves to correctly answer password security questions on the site and use stolen credit cards to order duplicate copies of active licenses such as those ordered by people who misplace their licenses or report them stolen a replacement license costs 11why is the name of the criminal organization being withhelddps officials are not calling the incident a data breach because they say no hacking was involved and vast amounts of data were not being stolen instead the crime group used data obtained from underground sources to bypass a simple password security system laying bare a security vulnerability that should never have happened mccraw said is this not still a data breachcybersecurity experts have known for a while that security questions in their current form do prove you are the account owner all they prove is that the person answering the questions knows the answers and more likely than not multiple people know the answers to the questions mother maiden name your motherthe lone star is a security rating thenthat info including previous addresses and family names allowed thieves to correctly answer password security questions on the site wtf this only reinforces the fact that not having a real mfa multiple factor authentication where the second authentication factor is outside of https is such a critical design flaw no portal which handles personal data should be allowed to exist if it does use mfa like email address or cellphonebruuhhh kinda headline gore but def not dps best worki swear there is so much corruption going on its amazing anything works right at allabbott and paxton couldn t give 2 shits about it either when will texans wise up and send these 2 shysters packingtexas has a problem a big problem the real question is will they actually do the correct thing and contact the individuals who were negatively impacted or will they send that information to their voter integrity group and disqualify the innocent voters based on what i see in texas team abbott and his puppet mccraw will opt for the second option remember uvaldehow many did the tank and healer sendtexas law enforcement upholding their one star ratingrepublicans took over texas completely when bush became governor in 1996 since then single party republican rule has gutted state services they quickly began outsourcing services to companies owned by wealthy campaign contributors companies like accenture and ibm came into run hr and it services with predictably comically awful results it has been failure after failure for decades now voters never hold them accountable so they just keep the shell game going increasing it evenduped implies they had no knowledge of aiding the crimes and no intent that not how dps works their attitude against innocents shows they have that acronym for a reason we did is a was fearing for our lives variant and nothing more somebody in there got paid for thismeanwhile i just moved here and have been struggling for a month to get my license when it expires in a weekalso the dmv sells your dataeveryone messes with texasgreg abbott will not stand for thismy korean american friend who lived her entire life in jersey had to move to texas temporarily due to her husband army relocation she heard of every asian slurs she never heard b4 on her first day she hates every day theretexas the 1 star statepulling personal data on individuals with asian surnames from the dark web and other underground portals we was hackah shit i m an asian texan this is cool and i have a common last name funwe re not happy at all i can tell you that one bit mccraw said you do fucking saythat what you get for having dps lead should have used a tank or healer leadfirst the dps screws up in uvalde now this when will the head of dps be firedis it time for another yellow peril erathis headline got crazier as it went onso some republican friend of abbot got the contract for a faulty website that has an insanely easy to bypass security system meanwhile all these secure ids could have been used to bypass tsa vote get a job get credit transfer over titles and so on and the best they can offer is a big ups do you know how many security checks i have to pass just to enter my time forecast and timecard i need a duo pass i need to be in the company vpn that itself requires password plus duo and nevermind when i jump into the clients domains pin plus token passcode plus bio etc it boggles the mind that a site like that should be diamond hard is easier to breach than a fricking facebook account hell even my foreign bank account in a shit hole country requieres geo verification pluskhan souphonousinphone better watch his backof course because texasyeah big surprise it not as though tx law enforcement agents were above the law rightfvck texas this is awesome and very funnytexas the florida of the westi wonder how often this happens in other states i guessing frequently but maybe in smaller numberschinese crime organization targeting around 2 years ago i texan was getting a lot of scam calls in an asian language i believe chinese i thought it was odd as even if the scammers were overseas l they know they re calling american number so why not use english i wonder if that was part of phishing for this also the chinese consulate in houston https was setting fire to documents in 2020i feel bad for all the innocent victims that were affected by this this is a classic example of your state government being inept lazy af and just plain careless goas someone who lives near the border i can say with certainty that quite a few chinese nationalists come up through mexico and this is precisely how they get an id to start working in restaurants i not a build a wall douchebag do even care but it happening they are malicious just looking to make money i know some that stockpile shit from china in their apartment and sell via ebay storessome of are really ignorant asian organized crime group does not mean ccp there are plenty of gangs active in the us and have none of you heard of the triad or yakuza a nyc blood set did this exact same thing during the pandemic they ran people for millions and only got caught because a few of them bought aston martins and anybody expecting texas law enforcement to figure this out knows very little about texas copsremovedwhy are the state who wants to require licenses for everything so loose with the checks and balances on giving them outthis is a classic example of people who do know what a hack is you do need to be sitting at your desk typing away code it called social engineering and it is hacking it using a system intended for one thing to do another and it is a data breach there is no reason that hacking needs to have occurred for a data breach to occur but the only way it could be a hack is if the entire dps blatantly and intentionally provided the licenses illegallywell that thar requires a real special kind a stupidtxdps and always dropping the ball name a better duogoing to be a lot of smuggled people who have drivers licensesjeezus these we re not happy at all i can tell you that one bit mccraw said in testimony to a house appropriations subcommittee golly gee you re not happy not happy at all regarding fraud and identity theft they should have had controls should have been in place and they never should have regulations i think the word you re looking for is regulations theresorry i am from texas and somehow my gut tells me they allowed it to happen wish i did think like thiswhen the state officials and their underlings have a desire to establish a theocratic ethnostate endangering the state minorities is par for the courseaccidentally yeah we are totally that gullible not like they didnt sell out to the ccp fuckin traitorstexans seem to think they re the shit but they re constantly get duped by the people they vote forthe asian voting block was fairly middle of the road moderate in texas and growing you piss off the chinese americans there the republicans will lose a large chunk of voters who tolerated their policies up until nowyet another reason i m glad i don t live in a texasi know love to hate on texas but this could had happen to any state as long as they allow license replacement to be requested onlinetexas vying with ohio florida in the race to the bottomwhich is it are the folks down there stupid or hopelessly corruptthis is a bug its a feature whenever people say living in a high cost of living area is a nah homie basic safety from the local government should be a luxury in an advanced developed nationgreg abbott won t leave until texas is a proper dumpster fireahh yes texas the do nothing right statecant wait to hear how this is joe biden faulttexans are too busy doing corrupt things to notice the banana peels in their path they will fall down every single time a simple issue comes upheadline should read texass dps conned 3000 times by chinese syndicatethis is why we need a minimum income so people do get into

did we start spelling dumb asnice the gop is finally being labeled a organized crime group about timenanthat fund should be taken from the officer s agency that was responsiblewhat an incredibly stupid way for a municipality to be out 29 million dollars those are tax dollars of hard working la residents because the cops couldn t help themselves from sharing gruesome pictures of dead people such an incredible waste of moneylos angeles county has agreed to pay nearly 29m to nba superstar kobe bryant widow after police shared graphic images of his fatal helicopter crash two years agomeanwhile east palestine ohio residents get 5 each and all the cancersso what was the punishment for the la sheriffs who were involved a semi stern talking to and 1 hour or retraining plus they had to write i will not share pictures of dead people i take at 10 times on a white board where are all those good cops i keep hearing about calling out this behavior that s what i thoughtah look the police helping to use tax dollarsyour tax dollars hard at workcurious how that compares to what kobe paid that girl he rapedin case you mad about someone earning 29m of taxpayer money when they already worth 600m she donating it all to charity as she wants justice not money maybe it might help the tax write off but what the cops did is despicable and i definitely sue if i were in her positionjuly 2003 bryant was charged with sexually assaulting a employee of the lodge and spa at cordillera in edwards colo he admitted that he didn t explicitly ask for consent and initially denied even having sex with the woman he left a bruise on her neck and drew blood from her skin after bryant s defense team badly intimidated the victim and smeared her reputation she refused to testify after the criminal case was dismissed bryant issued an apology that said in part after months of reviewing discovery listening to her attorney and even her testimony in person i now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this the money should go directly to kobes victimswow just what the tax payers needed thanks kobe s wifethis poor lady jesus i guess i did pay enough attention to the story originally to see that her and kobe kid died in the crash tooi hope she starts a college charity fund for people in the los angeles area with that money a charity that has little to no overhead and exists simply to return money to taxpaying familiesi assume the family does need the money and taxpayers will have to pay since they sued the county and not the people directly i understand wanting to hold people accountable but how are they being held accountable with this lawsuit if the people who did this do have to pay this story does feel like a win for anyone i feel like kobe name should be nowhere near any of this it crushing to see his legacy end like thiswhy did he rape her too this guy was a piece of shit good riddancewhy are some people more mad at her for winning a lawsuit than for the creepy cops that shared photos of her dead husband and childso is she going to donate it to a good causeit s stupid she doesn t need 29 million she s already richi get the reason behind the lawsuit and i m not criticizing her for it but la has really become overrun by tent cities that s left the city drenched in stale urine and feces the fact that weed smoke immediately hits u in the face the moment u step outside is a blessing i m but it s like being in a car with the windows rolled up with a chain smoker with the state of things in la the amount that the county will owe highlights the californian oligarchy of which won t be the ones paying bryant outso let me get this straight it the cops that tormented vanessa and the bryant family by distributing kobe photos but it the citizens and taxpayers who will ultimately pay that billnanthat seems a bit excessive and overly litigiouswould i be right in saying there sued and successfully suedpeople looking for their payday the bullet left the gun and entered one single person this was a handgun not a cannonmoney grab the woman who died s family has a legit case against baldwin and the movie this kind of lawsuit on the other hand is an obvious money grab they just want his lawyers to settle while he focuses on his criminal casedeep pockets enters the lunchroom chati know that what happened was terrible but why was there a real bullet in the studio in the first place why two people failed to check the gun was it a set upi would like to sue alec for the pain and suffering he has caused us all where do i sign upthis is the problem when you the richest person on set and there are a ton of protections that were ignored and you somewhere in that line alec baldwin most likely was supposed to check the fire arm before firing or maybe even taking possession of it although it seems difficult to really put that all on an actor because there are things like rubber rounds and dummies that are put into guns unfortunately he is probably not the person who deserves the most blame but his deep pockets fame and outspoken politics will make sure he takes most of itthis seems off i get it it is traumatic to watch someone be shot and die that sucks truly should we be suing everyone for every thing that traumatized us a separate issue that is being litigated are the blast injuries come on repeated exposure to shooting and other loud noises absolutely have a negative impact on hearing but it isn t as though a single shot from a pistol is going to upend a person s world just by being in proximity just ask those of us who spend considerable time around firing guns this is just seeing an opportunity and going for it it reminds me of the doofus reporter who wrote about how a single shot bruised his shoulder how the ejected brass disoriented him he wrote that smell of sulfur and destruction made me kuntzman is the name of the reporter in case anyone wants to read his piece the round is actually pretty anyways i dislike baldwin for a variety of reasons but it seems that he was the final piece in a series of mistakes and oversights he deserves his day in court same as anyone as does the victim s family these sorts of things must be adjudicated but piling on to take advantage of a bad situation is wrongconsidering most of the crew has no idea where their next paycheck is coming from like 90 of the time they gon na milk whatever teat they can get their hands on even if they have to steal it from someone who was party to a fucking accident this shit just needs to stopi have no problems with making this mistake as expensive as possible to make sure that no one else makes itseems like a toxic work environmentgot to cash in where you cangot ta get paid since they can t complete shootingthe injury is anxiety and ptsd in a normal society free medicare they could be treated for that free of charge no need for expensive lawyers nor gruelling in court just actual treatment for the trauma if someone did eventually end up as being at fault then the state would ensure the cost of treatment is recovered from the guilty part and they still say wellfare systems are more expensivei don t like the guy but come on this is getting ridiculousblast injuries so i can sue everyone next to me next time i go to a gun rangewtf would you use a real gun in a movie like you know

irreparablewhen it comes to the very high bar to prove defamation in this country especially by a news organization everything i ve read and am reading seems to show that this is looking more and more like a case that will be handily won by the plaintiff the revelations coming out from fox news is to say the least damaging and to say the most possibly company ending for fox if the things that will be shared at trial are anything like what i ve read it should be fairly easy to find defamation it s maybe even enough to get a massive punitive damages assessment in addition to the billion being asked for in compensatory damages here s hoping anywayshut the channel the fuck downturns out the media republicans and conservatives have been screaming about was fox news all along who could have seen that comingi just want to see that network go down in flames had it with they re divisive liesseditious conspiracy every executive in fox news should be charged with seditious conspiracy as

constantly a warning label that is similar to what cigarettes haverupert murdoch is an enemy of the truth and the entire fox empire should be dismantledca wait for somehow some way without any reasoning the supreme court to get involved and fix this for themq about fox endorsing the narrative of a stolen election correct a no some of our commentators were endorsing it he is so smart infallible defenseattorneys so you admit to your company lying about dominion murdoch no no not me or the company just the reporters and their production crew and like the staff that book the guests that help spread the lies and perhaps more than a few middle managers that approve the guests and of course there may be a chance that our accountants promptly paid for it all under the guidance of the ceo speaking for the company but not the company or me who is in fact the ceoohhhhhhhhhh how quickly he threw maria b lou d sean h and others under the bus and called them just commentators eta misspelled busdominion the hero we needed a company with enough money to come along and not give two shits about settling keep going drag those ratfucking cunts through the mudhe should be deported for attempting to undermine the nation he willingly immigrated tocome on americans have a fucking spine and protest this this is massive it is sad that a bombshell like the murdochs giving biden election ad info to the trumps is just a footnote in this story that alone is another big story that should get fox news booted i don t know how the murdochs sleep at night people like tucker hannity etc are just pawns the real fucker is rupertlove it murdoch blames the tv personalities but doesn t blame fox for dominion wait for hannity bartiromo and others to flip on fox it s going to be fun to watch as the fox rats flip on each otherwell saying anything else would have been perjuryand fox news viewers will never hear a single world about thiseven with all that cheating he still lost biglythe damage to our democracy will last for decadesthe day they throw murdoch in prison and pull the plug on faux news will be my second favorite only to locking up trump for his litany of crimes and seditionnot fox just the but not foxin his deposition murdoch rejected that the talk network as an entity endorsed former president donald trump s election lies but murdoch conceded that sean hannity jeanine pirro maria bartiromo and former host lou dobbs promoted the falsehood about the presidential contest being stolen pussy ca even own itfox news is the poison killing this countrynot fox but maybe lou dobbs maybe maria as commentators murdoch said in his deposition and we officially entered the throw everyone else under the bus phaseand he knew it so he culpablecan i sue them for all the years i had to fight with my parents over them believing the lies fox pushed i could use a billionrupert murdock acknowledged what already been proven in his own emails i would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight he added i really wish i had not done this awful thing that i am now facing the consequence for is not really a legal justification or defense for doing that awful thing in fact it more of what you would call a confession an admission that you know you fucked aroundwell as a conglomerate multimedia monopoly what do you think would happen when you incentivize and support divisive extreme false claims and rhetoric it effectively enables those scenarios to be peddledwell yeah they did it on national television rupert not in some back room where it was a handful of people i didn t think that was even in questionwell i hope the rest of the media can quit treating fox like it is legit news they can no longer hide under its just our pundits crap they straight up compromised their news well we knew they always have but the media has always treated them as somewhat legitthe ftc needs to put a disclaimer on fox news every 30 min to let people know it not real news but satire just like they did with jackass attention do not believe what tucker sean and laura are saying none of it is true factsfox says it should not be held liable for the hosts claims lol yeah i sure they all just out there wingin it on air with absolutely no guidance or anything from the network real quality news program you running there murdochtheir slogan fair balanced was laughable before but now it just seems criminally misleadingfoxnews should have to change their name to fox opinion rupert murdoch is basically an enemy of the state at this pointman they re lucky their audience is so fucking dense it really doesn t matter how crazy the headline those suckers eat it uphe should be stripped of his empire and his citizenship rescindedconfirmed that fox is fake newswent to costco and bought popcorn lots of popcornfair and balanced they acknowledged that trump was lying about the election that s fair and they balanced that out by saying the opposite on the airas part of the settlement negotiations it would be nice if dominion could say give us 400 million less but for two weeks every host on fox news has to start with a few lines stating explicitly we lied to you the election was not stolensedition is supposed to be a serious crime in a workingof course they did the important part is left out of the title rupert murdoch acknowledged that fox news hosts endorsed false stolen election claims cnn businessthe death of faux news should occur it wo but it shouldnot only the hosts but the brass including the murdoch and son and all the resti think life would be better if rupert murdoch never existed he has poisoned so many people all over the world with the lies he spews through his mediai can t wait until dominion owns itself a media company when this is said and donei say let see what these dipshit conservatives think about fox now but they wont know until they watch fox later tonightacknowledged that fox news hosts endorsed stolen election claims i thought there only opinion no news on fox liarshut them down nowthen fox news can not be treated as a news organization any more the first amendment free press no longer applies to them they don t get to keep their sources quiet anymore unless they want to be charged as an accessory if anyone from fox news has any connection to jan 6 then rico the whole organization jail timehow can murdoch deny something that he saw and heard along with millions around the world from his own dumbass pundits they screwed the poochi hope sean and tucker remembers that ol daddy rupe bent over backwards to protect rebekah brooks when she actively and deliberately did the wrong thing but would hesitate to throw them under the busgood he admitted it now shut that shit down and imprison him for spreading misinformation which should be akin to treason ban that candy ass family from the usa and let move forward into progress we are in the year 2023 ffs not 1823fox news not un american but watched by every un american person in the countryrupert murdoch is a piece of fucking shit and i apologize to all shits ever for comparing this piece of fucking shit to themhosts sorry mate those are crisis actorsjust had a curiosity i went to the fox website and i was unable to find a story about this shocked i say shockedis rupert murdoch an enemy of all humanity or just the united states seems like he doing satan workthe people who need to know this will never be told and if they are they won t believe itand so who going to get punished for this let me guess no one what ever happened to justicei say this is conspiracy to seditionfuck rupert murdoch the wall street journal fox news and all his other shady shitno shit fuck fox news ruining our countryreported by cnn fox news would never have the balls to publicly admit on their station that they wrongnow anyone who continues watching fox is an idiot and they will themselves know it balanced my assis he an immigrant i say he shown contempt for the american constitution and should have his citizenship revoked he can go back to where ever he came fromah the slimy trumpers will still deny itthey should lose any right to ever host an election debate they can not be trusted fox is a top down company and when murdoch says jump everyone says how high does matter if they were reluctant 9n the background what matters is what they say and do over the air i really gone fox crashes and burns they deserve iti forgot to ask what the penalty for giving an opponent ads to trump prior to the ads going public eta speech to adsi wonder if he regrets the monster he created or if he just too old and rich to gafthe day he is no longer in control of the media will be such a grand dayand yet these unethical liars are still on the air and laughing all the way to the bank tragically the ignorant morons that listen to them and continue to believe what they say are beyond redemption and always will be worse than the worst cult as it s helped destroy the countryit not something that should be said lightly but it will be a great day when murdoch diesone would think smartmatic could also use this evidence in their billion dollar lawsuit or if the federal government ever brought a lawsuit against fox news for profiting off of blatant lies and undermining the truthrupert murdoch should go down in history as one of the most damaging individuals to have ever existed might not be a murderer or rapist or dictator but he has polarised society in ways it may never recover fromhopefully big wins from dominion and smartmatic will set bold precedents for future litigants too cause if they win billions from fox the sharks will start circlingyou know it s bad when paul ryan tells you to stop lyingoh no but i was told over and over and over and over and over again that the media was liberal so this can t possibly be trueunfortunately rupert is still alivefuck murdoch fuck fox fucki keep on seeing his name in tonight s keep hoping it s an obituary but it s noti wonder if these pieces of trash realize what they ve done by perpetuating baseless lies lining their pockets at the cost of their ownwhat are we the people doing to do about this blatant sedition and treason the us will not return to democracy until the murdocks and the entire right wing media apparatus is completely shut downhe merely admitted to the truth found in all the emails and documents what else was he going to do on his bullshit like the idiot politicians they were trying to protectthis will positively absolutely not matter to fox viewersmeanwhile they spew new bullshit and nothing changesq in fact you are now aware that fox endorsed at times this false notion of a stolen election a not fox no not fox but maybe lou dobbs maybe maria as commentators so who at fox did the janitorhey merrick garland how about criminal conspiracy to defraud the united states of america charges under 18 286 and criminal seditious conspiracy under 18 2384i don t know how dominion can lose this case at this point never underestimate fox news lawyers to weasel them out of it though everybody that participated in the lie repeated it for weeks and it s cost dominion potentially billions of dollars i think they even lost contracts with some state governments over this i do hope fox newsmaxx and that other one all crash and burn they will deserve every terrible thing that got them theremurdoch should be arrested the damage a single individual can do globally because of his amassed wealth is truly shocking all for more profit disgustingole murdoch falling back on the way to commit crimes remember jerry it not a crime if you admit to doing itit was just the hosts you cunt it was you and your entire fuckin companynow as a punishment fox news must rename itself in propagandawe know we knew the whole time it not about politics never was it about and gaining seats in congressokay so when are they no longer allowed to call themselves news we really should have a handle on this kind of shitall the people who need to hear this aren t going to believe anything cnn says anyways lolno wonder fox viewers r so dumbed downtime for hannity carlson and ingraham to admit it no ballssean hannity jeanine pirro maria bartiromo and former host lou dobbs fox now admits that these people were lying that good i say that endorsed is kind of a weak term promoted or trumpeted sounds more like the truthhe doing this cause he knows fox news from a legal standpoint is sunk it just too bad dominion wo bankrupt the network i would be surprised if the fox lawyers have not repeatedly told him to try and keep settling although i do wonder after revelations that fox was sharing biden ads etc to the trump campaign before they aired what is the legality of thatknown liar admits lyingthey should all be held accountable especially rupertannnnnd nothing will be doneonly the truly loyal trump supporters will dismiss this psychologists would diagnose these people as delusional is an act of the people are unable to grasp reality are they beyond helpjordan klepper has a lot of new material to work witha question from abroad now that this arise are there any reactions from the maga crowdbecause of course they did fox news being the propaganda arm of the republican party is the worst kept secret in the worldsounds like he tossing all the show hosts under the bushow about changing that headline to knowlingly endorsed false election claims they admitted to spreading lies to save their stock portfolis and jobsaustralian billionaire owner of fox news entertainment admits that he doesn t give a flying f ck about americathat makes him an accessory in the deaths of the capitol police and the ones who were injured can sue the living shit out of himfox really is fair and balanced both reality and fiction get equally representedhopefully after the huge lawsuits fox news will be out of businessany outcome that does not result in fox being pulled off the air after all this is a failuredeletedthere all this bullshit debate between the left and right about who lying but this seems to be the way to find out just get them on the record under oath suddenly they know exactly what true and what not it so fucking blatant that i can no longer believe anyone on the right is fooled they are all fully complicit they are convinced they are justified in lying to get what they want they abandoned all pretense of good faith when they get on the stand we see who they really arert disappeared time for fox news to do the samenot to worry if us history has taught me anything it that anyone possessing the level of wealth known as f k you money is incapable of being held accountable for any crime they commithe seems to think throwing his hosts under the bus somehow removes the culpability from his company yet his company continued to pay and employ and air those hosts despite their knowingly false claims he just tanked any chance he had at getting out of this lawsuitwhy is anyone surprised about thiswell i never saw this coming i can not believe those paragons of american virtue would stoop so lowanyone have a link to the docsluckily for faux no one believed anything that was broadcast on its outletsso is this indicative of a crimeyesterday i heard and i hope you are sitting down for this that water is wet in liquid formhead of the dragon admitting what the rest of its body has already wreckedoh imagine that fox news lied for money i m shockedthis breaking news just in rupert murdoch admits something we already all knew and now a rebuttal from faux news is not i know you are but what am ihe trying to distance the company from liabilitywait fox news is fake newshe just throwing them under the bus to save his investmentsmurdoch is the world cancerwould love to see a new reality series on fox yeah i know that part is with roll with it where aussie murdoch has to endure nature facing off against some of australia s fiercest critters tonight join us as rupert spends the night in a face hugger spider this week will the dingoes eat his babycompeting with tabloids is a conscious business decisionlol he seems so apologetic lmao what a pathetic joke they should all be in prison or at least fined out the ass and forced to shut downnow the question becomes can hannity carlson and ingraham be sued individuallyi am not shocked by how unethical the hosts at fox news are after all it a conspiratorial punditry that tries to pass itself off as a news channel it was only a matter of time before fox news got in trouble in a manner that their lawyers wo ve able to get them out of i hope fox has to pay the highest damages availablelet be clear he was informed they were lies acknowledged they were and then chose not to interfere ie complicit not only did he allow these lies he encouraged the punishment of a reporter on his network for seeking to debunk them he then fed info from biden ads to the trump campaignand that he gave kushner a preview of all of biden campaign adscapone acknowledged his thugs endorsed the beatings of shop owners who refused to pay insurance not that capone had anything to do with itfox and trump go hand in hand with fake newsthere is plenty of video evidence so what else could he dothis reeks of shit i don t trust fox news even if they admit they lied seems like they re trying to derail the trump train to make room for desantisit would be fitting if fox news ended at the same time as hbo s successionso brave to admit something that everyone already knewdoes that just doom his defense in the dominion lawsuit he clearly admitted that dominion charges are valid and that he regrets it and wishes he had done it sounds like he cookedthis will be received like health warnings on smokes dietary information on fast food if you find one person who abandons them over this i will be surprised what i was duped my whole opinions are based on lies and propaganda they played me for a gullible idiot i must seek the truth on bbc and npr rightplease let this be the nail in the coffin for that propaganda companythe real question is did murdoch order the code redheadlines to my friends on the right continue to spew conspiracy theories if that is your thing legal jeopardy is the result if guilty is the verdict broke you will be see alex jones as an exampleto give people an understanding of the reach of this channel two to three million people over the age of 50 are watching this channel all day long throughout the day seven days a week it on as their companion there has been no mention or acknowledgment of this story on fox news rupert murdock knows his audience will remain as long as he reinforces the viewer views even if it does have a basis in truth fox news is not alone in behaving this without ethics in journalism political talk radio is dominated by right wing radio they all have these same views where they are knowingly are spreading misinformation to their listeners they have the view the customer is always right to keep the audience from tuning off their programs the end result is behavior like january 6th attack on the capital going back years earlier the audience was convinced obamacare was sending seniors to death panels instead of providing health care for this who did have health careonly the rubes fell for it who knew we all did but fox news profited off it now time to pay upexecute this fucking company and immediately rewrite what corporate governance and liability looks like people need to be in jail for this blatant hostile poisoning of our entire culture infuriating is putting it mildly that something so hallowed can be trifled with so easily by millionaires and billionaires directly motivated by profit and they took notes of their criminal fucking conspiracyyeah it s not a legit news sourcethis where the same people calling trump president months after the election dik riding at its finestdominion s lawsuit has always been more about what will generate headlines than what can withstand legal and factual scrutiny or replace dominion s lawsuit with fox newsnani thought passports were the property of the issuing countrypassport collectors know that the passport of ramesses ii is the jewel of the nilea diplomatic passport should be destroyed after it expires the egyptian embassy would have destroyed it if they followed protocol it likely ended up in a burn bad which was dumped in the trash unless theft can be established this is a story of one man s garbage being another man s 40kits come up for auction before and obviously wasnt important enough to be their heritage then sorry but this just feels like the family being fussy to stay relevant hereseems like a private document that shouldn t be allowed to be sold unless the seller can establish sadat gave it to someone and said it was okay to sell it i get that s he is was a public figure but that s still a private document i d feel the same way about a birth certificate or medical records or an old driver s license or whatever seems like the only way it could come into someone other than the family s possession is through nefarious means or accidental losswhy does he still use itwho is in the market for sadat s passport edit i stand corrected there are a lot of redditors in the market for sadat s passport better start saving upnani guessing that their surprise inspection did go wellminot has endured frequent dismissals over the past two decades including the 91st missile wing operations support squadron commander in 2021 the 69th bomb squadron and 91st security forces group commanders in 2018 the 741st missile squadron commander in 2014 the 91st missile wing commander in 2009 and the 5th bomb group commander in 2007 base misconduct has invited increased scrutiny in that time as well firings have come in response to widespread cheating on the monthly proficiency test for missileers mishandling of nuclear weapons unprofessional conduct and drug use yikes60 minutes did a report a few years ago on the missile stations about how dated the system is and how demoralized the workers are just because the defense budget is massive every year doesn t mean those dollars are put to good usethe penalty for the officers involved was probably harsh in south dakotaso the article does tell us why they were fired however the base is worth billion dollars and i suspect that in the 8 months the commander ran the place shit did go wellsince we do know what the reason is i going to go straight to speculation that it was an orgy or somethingminot afb has been a crap show for a while nowwhen i was in gitmo our co was indicted in a death investigation and went to jail lol you can only sweep so much under the rug until the trash starts becoming obviouscould have been worse and have a missile explode in its launch silo on september 18 1980 at about an airman conducting maintenance on the titan ii missile dropped a wrench socket which fell about eighty feet before hitting and piercing the skin on the rocket s fuel tank causing it to leak httpsit a command that is fairly remote staff are sequestered underground the facilities are old and the technology is outdated the posting sucks you at least get steak on an ssbnso tom hanks and tom cruise just received screenplays kevin hart has a cameolem me gon na replace the command structure with a computer named the woprsure hoping this was only because these guys were just and not ya know infiltrators or spies or saboteursi guess at least the nuclear space has some consequences in 2023 it seems like so many other areas have no consequences for shitty work and attitude in 2023minot afb previously https had 25 airmen disciplined for accidentally flying a real nuke during a training exerciseread this as six missiles fired and had a mini heart attacki bet the reason was they got drunk as shit then something dumb happenedgeneral ripper is in control and setting up defensive strategies all is wellguess we know who s been bonking aliensthe leader faced six other earlier dismissals so the best place to station a problem child is a nuclear base send him packing nowit way more effective to fire missiles leaders do have the range or explosive forcei ve spent twelve years as a military lawyer the mission support commander supervises the logistics readiness squadron commander i m sure the other four subordinates were within that same chain of command this is either a toxic leadership situation or failure to address misconduct likely within lrs and the msg commander for not taking action stop with the speculation about how the colonel looks like he jerks off at his desk or whatever speculation is running rampant herefired as in or dischargethey better watch that site closelythis makes me think of the uncover human trafficking ring that was being run by 15 national guardsmen in nashville wonder why they where so abruptly fireddid this same thing happen like 8 years agocorrect me if i wrong but are there safety measures in place that ensures they only fire missiles weird how it can go wrong six consecutive timeswe in the next era of technology no longer do nuclear missiles work we now fire leaders at our enemiesman i lived in minot back in 2009 and this exact same thing happened back then there was also a plane that took off from mafb and landed in st louis and it turned out it had a nuclear payload on it that nobody knew about and also there was a time when they were transporting a nuclear missile thankfully without its warhead on the back of a truck and the ropes broke and it rolled right off the truck those guys really need to get their shit togetherin all likelihood this stems from a failed inspection audit or exercise or combination of all three the usaf conducts a variety of activities designed to test a base s or a unit s ability to perform its assigned mission when a base or units are assessed to be incapable of performing said mission that base or unit leadership can suffer humiliations like happened here when an officer is fired from a role it does not immediately mean he or she is actually forced out of the military usually when an officer is relieved of command he or she is taken out of his or her leadership role and reassigned to a job without that leadership component everyone in the officer corps knows that when that happens your career is over there will be no more advancement no more promotions no more leadership roles so most officers in that spot retire or if not he or she will resign his or her conmission in limited circumstances where violations of the uniform code of military justice are believed to have occurred officers like this might be they sometimes also choose an option known as rilo retirement in lieu of prosecutionclearly something was in violation of nuclear protocol question is how bad was itwith all the nuclear saber rattling a question some people have asked is if russia nukes even work if their invasion force did work as advertised maybe they have maintained their nukes and putin does even know because everyone up the chain is either too corrupt or too scared to admin the true it possible that a question other countries are asking about the us so stories like this help push the narrative that the us is ready to go this is important because if one side really believes the other side is able to retaliate it increases the likelihood of launching missilesthe air force sends their worst officers and airmen to the least desirable posting then is constantly surprised when those individuals do even worse jobs than they did to get the posting in the first placereminds me of an old sac routine the jobs get so stagnate and cozy the sneaky inspection walks through sees how fat everyone is getting and drops a bomb on the personnel i bet those people are not in as much trouble as media is given news aboutstandard maintenance paperwork was completed usually lrs units pencil whip it when it is realized it was up to date but it looks like minot was too lazy to do even thatloose lips sink shipshe looks like that guy from waterboythey were playing do whiz on the nuclear missilesmaybe the chinese spy ballon data revealed somethingcolonel in the pic reeks of i routinely jerkoff at workinsane shouldn t we get detailswhen they get fired are the kicked out of the militaryif it s this bad for the us think about the russian nuke s maintenance or the chinesei worked at a nuke base was fucking awful suicides drinking duis murders and this was in just 2 years at one baseit north dakota centered in nothing surrounded by less brutal winters sweltering muggy summers vapid i bet they were all drunk or had rolling hangovers mixed with speed useoften in the army leaders get complaciant checking off boxes becomes a higher priority than actually accomplishing goals i suspect a mix of that sexual misconductthey probably didn t initiate launch to take out the chinese balloonyet we always hear about how the russian missiles and nukes probably do not work ruh roh ours might not eitherdamn six of them and this guy gets picked to be the face of it lmaomissing machine gun and grenadesoh it s the air force like herding catstil the term for nuke missile techs are missileersi was recently listening to a podcast and someone emailed in obviously this is just an email so could be completely fake but i think it believable they said they work in an early warning site to detect ballistic missiles they claimed that the vast majority of the time they watch netflix and goof around even drawing penises on the control panelsthey had a recreational activity where they put on a play unfortunately they chose to do a rendition of either strangelove or seven days in may with real missileswhat does fired from a military job mean kicked into civilian life stay in the service but now you are sweeping floorsso they can just fire anything out of those silos even peoplegreat who was banging who this timeremovedsomebody was talking about the aliensnani ca see how it is controversial to say that someone who committed sexual violence against a certain gender should not be housed with that gender in prison and that goes for cis men who rape other cis men too put em in solitaryrapist jailed for 8 yearsremovedthe case sparked a heated debate over whether bryson should be housed in a male or a female prison after transitioning from a man to a woman hmm gee i wonder that seems like a tough onefrankly i do care if it was a lesbian eskimo midget ninja albino rapist the only term i concerned with is that last one no need for all the other identifiers that just meant to make people believe there anything different but there not a predator is a predatorif the prisoner has a penis put them in a male prison if not female prisondeletedmeanwhile cis male guards who been raping female inmates since the dawn are like phew no one noticing what we doing because they too busy over there making it about trans peopletl dr isla bryson began transition after being arrested there is a among authorities that this person is attempting to enter into the women prison system because they believe that it will be an easier term and so that they can victimize the women there in my own opinion they should go ahead and be incarcerated as a woman as long as they continue the transition process because they will quickly discover that being a transwoman in a women prison is no easier than going to a men prison and attempting to victimize the women there would be a fatal errorhere come the

knocking her unconscious and repeatedly hitting her because he was upset his nintendo switch was taken away will be charged as an adult court records show i okay with this sure looked like an adult as he viciously knocked out that womangood he has a history of previous assaults and his stint with juvenile justice clearly did teach him not to assault people so he deserves adult consequences now being six months shy of 18 should give him a pass on this violent of an assault when he already been treated as a juvenile for similar violent crimes hopefully adult jail will scare him enough he stops assaulting people before he kills someonebrendan depa the 6 2 230 lb adult student will be charged after attacking a defenseless woman he faces a charge of aggravated battery against a school employee a first degree felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison how to take a break on your way to hell httpsas a teacher i m tired of being a punching bag and never having the kids or parents held accountablei think the guy is special needs but still he s like 6 6 280lbs he should ve been at a different facilityhitting her in the head after she was already down should bump this up to attempted murder especially given that he explicitly said he was going to kill hermade comments that he would beat her up and kill her if i say i going to kill you and then i ambush you in a hallway and punch you in the back of the head even after you gone unconscious how is that not attempted murder genuine question though how are the prior statements and excessive violence after she lost consciousness evidence enough for the prosecution to pursue an attempted murder chargebut how is the teacher doingthe most disheartening thing about this was seeing all the twitter posts of people saying well that what she gets for taking his propertyparents just don t understand that the law doesn t care if you are on an iep in school so many parents think because their child has as a disability that we as teachers shouldn t provide consequences for poor behavior and they don t put consequences in place at home it s a rude awakening when the kid gets out there in the real worldjouranlists ca even spell it aide not aidi am sorry but it is simply insane to allow compassion for special needs people to override protecting the lives of innocents don t really care if they are called asylums prisons or whatever get these people isolated and presented from killing othersif you watch this disturbing footage again he goes from striking the body to striking the head repeatedly and ferociously if i was the da i would be asking for attempted murder not batteryforgive me for not having sympathy for this scum because he has a developmental disorder over the woman he just brutalized 3 previous battery arrests and he was definitely going to kill her if given much more time he does not belong in functioning societyso this boy did this 3 separate batteries roughly years ago in 2019 this kid should been put into therapy long ago already the charge against him right now just roughly messed up his life forever the woman still did not deserve this bad situation for everyone involvedfox 35 found that there used to be a specific school for troubled teens in flagler county for students who couldn t function in a traditional classroom environment had been charged

and you automatically go to jail it should not matter how old you are parents need to put this fear into there kids just watch the cameras in the roomsit s so upsetting seeing how kids in grade school treat teachers now i only graduated high school 6 years ago and never once in any of my schools growing up did i hear about a kid putting their hands on a teacher or have the courage to scream and belittle them now all over social media you got kids fighting and punching teachers screaming at them no respect whatsoever jeez i feel old and i just graduated college last summergood special needs is not an excusei hope he does get to play switch and misses breath of the wild 2he been charged with battery three times before this x200b he should been in a cage not a classroomthe irony in the school named matanza it means murder in spanishaide https not aid https i suppose i should be surprised it a fox news sitegracias a dios ese estudiante se comportó como un animal y agredió a esa pobre mujerwe need to start acting like investing in schools helps people even if they do have kids kids like this could have turned out a hell of a lot different if we treated schools as an investment in all of our futures and not just something we pay the bare minimum for i be surprised if he ever saw a real psychiatrist instead of just a string of barely paid guidance counselorsgood lock his violent ass in jail for a while and give him the help he needs to become a functioning member of society he not too young to course correctphysically he s an adult but mentally definitely a childwhat kind of name is matanzas it means killingsfor those of you who are not aware this was a special education student with a mental disability he attacked a paraprofessional this is a failure of the florida school system who is more focused on removing any lgbtq books from schools then actually funding them properly with proper staff httpsflagler co voters i m not going to pay 50 just so our educators don t get their ass beat they can act like a respectable person and bring a gun to workmatanzas high student commits una matanzaimagine going to jail because you wanted to play splatoon morewhy is it that in the united states even a high school name is massacrethe only thing he s going to be playing is a mantendo switchjust saying as a minor why was his rap sheet available to aren t minors records sealedofficials talk about having more supports for troubled teens what they need is to hire bouncers at school to deal with bulliesanother shit kid from a shit upbringing may his stay be a very long oneyeah i saw the video that was an unbelievably brutal attack that just kept going after the aide was incapacitated they need to be locked uponly charged because the footage is public schools throw these employees under the bus every day imagine that it was a male teacher and that he defended himself charges for surehe is completely fucking whacko thugmonkeys like that deserve a life behind bars there is no rehabilitationis this version of the story going to get locked too or did it finally blow up too much for reddit to hide itthe kid looked handicap to me but if he s average intelligence and of full metal capabilities then throw the book at himlock him up and make the fucker eat the keyexcellent he was born loserdeletedironic how such a childish motivation gets you tried as an adultyes great news clearly unhinged send him down for as long as possiblebut did he get his nintendo backi sure he mend his ways at crime campgood that was such an animalistic attack please send this person to jaili sure that many people will disagree with my thoughts on this and i will get lots of harsh feedback but personally i do care what happens to this kid or how harsh the penalty for his actions is as far as i am concerned they give him the death penalty realistically what the likelihood that he ever amounts to anything useful or productive he basically seems like a fucking monster who is inclined to be incredibly violent and is truly dangerous to society i would also submit that that man who casually walks over to the assault should also get the death penalty for being an absolutely pathetic worthless cowardly fucking piece of shit there are far too many evil worthless scummy dangerous people in the world and there far too much tolerance and forgiveness for the legitimately bad people the sooner that some people die the better because the world will become a better safer place without them living in itwhat is sad about this is this kid life is over he probably be well into his 20s by the time he gets out of prison and he is on track to basically be a career criminal if he had gotten help with anger management when he needed it this whole situation may have been avoidablehe may not have mental health issues he may just be a violent prickthis could happen anywhere a certain percentage of kids act as if they are addicted to their devices and become combative if asked to turn them off or put them away between classes you see kids walking down the hallways navigating while glued to their phones recently i took a warehouse job working with mostly younger people we were repeatedly counseled not to be texting or looking at our phones while walking around the warehouse digital nativeslock this animal up and throw away the key i m happy with my taxes being used to keep him away from decent humanspeople making excuses for this piece of he s an attempted murderer i don t give a hoot about his issues or his home life or special needs he flat out beat a woman and could have killed her over a toy stop trying to explain away peoples decisions because life wasn t kind to them it s not their fault such bullshitit disappointing to see many comments in here that dont seem to take into account this attackers mental limitations nearly killing school staff over taking up a switch the tone and cadence of his speech especially am i going to jail they really point towards someone who is who probably should have been either in a more specialized facility or with more specialized 100 i do fault the lady who was attacked the responsibility for this event in my opinion lies on the school administration i hope the lady is able to recover fully and i hope she suueeeesssssss the shit out of the school for not taking the appropriate steps to protect her and the student from this and i hope the student is not entered into the hell that is the criminal justice system and incarnation and instead gets the help and care he needs even if that means temporary prolonged or even permanent institutionalization just cause his condition is his fault does mean we should take steps to prevent or limit his ability to hurt others thank you for coming to my ted talkgood hopefully by the time this asshole gets out of prison they are on nintendo switch 8he is more adult than 95 of adults in terms of physical strength anywayyou wan na act like a tough man get fucking charged as a tough manif the kid passes the psychological test he should be charged as an adult this being florida though i doubt he will get thatso children are to be protected in society period our society though has no respect for grown ups most other societies respect eldersgood if you hit an unconscious person fuck youbrutally beats a teachers aid over a nintendo this is why no one wants to be a teacher florida schools are day care at the pointgood he absolutely shouldjust go arrest his parents for a fact this kid has experienced abuse and horrible upbringingcan they also charge the dude dressed like a marine that was just casually strolling up while this lady was getting beatthe govt has let the teacher s aide and kid with serious issues down thank goodness she was not killed but will surely be suffering with ptsd possibly for life keep cutting taxes and support for those that can t afford to pay for it themselves and watch this kind of mess continue to get worse maybe desantis can ship the kid off to another city and make it all betteri really don t like the concept of charging those under 18 as an i mean this as a blanket observation not necessarily in this specific casei keep telling people schools need to make an example out of kids like that beat them in front of the school until their legs stop working make their parents watch tell them get your home right or we ll be happy to do it for you it s the only way with these new gen american scumthe kid has a disability according to the article the school didn t have the resources for this type of student which lead to this circumstance it s because he black he s getting tried as an adult i d put money on it he s a big black scary kid with a cognitive disability to quote another article ese also referred to as special education may include students who have profound emotional or behavioral difficulties and for whom public schools often provides the most sustained and effective environment it is inevitable that at times students will and do act out and at times hurt the very people helping https this kid has a lot of serious problems and the treatment center that was unable to help him and have proper safety and staff are not charging the child as an adult for assault this child might literally not even completely but because he s big and that s there s a lot of failures here and the wrong people are going to fox 35 found that there used to be a specific school for troubled teens in flagler county for students who couldn t function in

issues and was failed by the system and now since the system doesn t want to take responsibility they re just gon na go the scary black man route and move onsomeone s getting stuffed in the arse for hitting a womanif we charge every teen as an adult whenever it sounds serious or makes headlines why bother ever setting an age in the first place we know his brain literally does have a complete understanding of the consequences of his actions and wo for at least a few more years either this matters or it does nope instead we let our emotions decide on a case by case basis because that surely wo lead to biasa million dollar bond wow that s crazythank goodness these citizens did have to worry about 50 in property tax i sure housing this dude for 15 to 20 will be much cheaper this is why they want school vouchersaide leave it to florida fox news to make a spelling error in their headlinewhen they said charged as an adult brain said i bet he s black it s hard being right all the timehe got this mad about a nintendo he s very clearly a child get him help don t throw away the key just yets not an adult he s a child what s the point of having a distinction between adults and children

words into that headline and was expecting a much different endinglol you know who terrible at keeping secrets five year old kids that whopoor kid is gon na grow up and realize he betrayed family for no benefit over their personal drug use i feel bad for himsnitches gethow weird that the article neglects to mention how the 5 year old was related to the woman arrested i guess child turns in mother would pull the same clicksi like to think if i were a cop i pretend i did hear that and wish them a good evening and leave for fear of any consequences that kid might face for getting their family busted unless the warrant was for something crazy like murderfive years old is no excuse for snitching 18th birthday watch out sonall those years of playing hide and seek finally paid offofficers praised the child for his honesty then went and wrote up a police report full of fabricationsnanthe bill requires desantis a republican to appoint a board to oversee the government services that the disney district provides in its sprawling theme park properties in florida what the article doesn t mention is what power do this board have seems like disney could still voice opposition to any bill they wantedso basically five good friends of desantis are about to get some sweet pointless jobsjust to clear up a common misconception i keep seeing on threads like this this bill that was signed today will not transfer any debt to county and it does not put them on the line to pay for disney services the bill that passed last year was going to dissolve the rcid completely had that bill gone into effect this summer it would have passed along that debt and put that financial burden on the two counties the florida republicans not having put any thought into that bill realized that they be screwed so they back peddled and introduced a new bill this year the new bill instead of dissolving the district would keep it intact and replace the leadership board with five board members it would also force the rcid to change its name in two years so this new bill that was just signed does not offload any debts onto florida taxpayers nor does it force the two counties to pay for disney services all that said it still a wildly stupid bill it was done to purely give the illusion that desantis beat disney in a culture war i already seen republicans celebrating that disney is now going to pay their fair share without realize that disney through the rcid has always been paying more than their fair share and that this bill will not impact their tax burden in either direction they also seem to be celebrating that disney will no longer be getting special treatment that too is completely false the district and the rules within it still exist they still getting their special treatment and there no reason to think this new board will stop that all one has to do is look at the fact that during the height of this pr battle desantis made no effort to take away the millions in tax breaks disney was getting for their new lake nona campus project he did want to actually hurt disney he wanted to look like he hurt disney because they spoke up against his culture war nonsense all in all this was a dumb useless bill that serves as nothing but ammo for desantis for when he runs next year disney did get got but the bill was crafted in a way that it does matter his supporters are going to dig deep enough to realize that they just going to keep on falsely thinking that woke disney got put in their placeper how is this harmful to the local answer so way back in the day when disney was first looking to open their park they needed a lot of infrastructure built the park was going to be larger than many small towns built on undeveloped swampland this meant brand new electrical water sewage police fire department ambulance etc services for the park all needing to be built out from scratch this was going to cost a great deal of money and naturally the local residents were not super excited about seeing their taxes raised to make that happen the spending would likey have bankrupted the counties in question similarly disney was not happy about how long most municipal infrastructure projects take to finish they needed the infrastructure as fast as possible so the county government struck a deal with disney disney would pay for the infrastructure themselves and in exchange would be given near total control over how that money was spent via the creation of the reedy creek improvement district a government under the control of the disney corporation this made everyone happy local residents did have to pay for the park infrastructure and disney got to hire their own people to build that infrastructure on their own timelines sure disney would have to pay local municipal taxes earmarked for infrastructure but that was because they had to pay for their own infrastructure entirely out of pocket this worked well for everyone for over 50 years keep in mind this was just about infrastructure and municipal services disney still had to adhere to any of the other laws and ordinances that the saw fit to put in place all that changed was that disney managed it itself so for example they would pay for local fire departments but would instead run their own for the park they still had to have a fire department they would just run it on their own dime disney never had absolute power over the land fast forward to today when disney came out against some of desantis legislation in retaliation desantis decided to strip disney of this special status and fold their land back under the control of the counties this was done for economic or execution reasons but rather out of spite most of the services disney provided in reedy creek were superior to those offered by surrounding counties ending the special district only serves to recreate the problems that it was initially developed to solve disney has openly said that if the special district is dissolved local taxpayers would be on the hook for 1b in infrastructure bonds that disney is currently obligated to pay if you take over the infrastructure you take over servicing the debt accrued to create that infrastructure the local counties would also be on the hook for providing all of the municipal services disney requires a logistical challenge they are to take on after desantis was informed of all of this he and the florida legislature backed off of their original position dissolving reedy creek and instead moved to have the reedy creek board controlled by governor appointees rather than disney itself disney is still unhappy about this arrangement as they are basically the only entity in reedy creek yet wo have control over what infrastructure is built to meet their needs contrary to the deal they made 50 years ago when they built the park and has worked well for everyone since so no this is a step towards greater control and regulation of corporate entities it is a petty decision that actually hurts local citizens by taking away a limited and necessary power given to a unique corporate entity original comment to give proper credit can be found here httpsis it generally considered a bad idea to piss off the biggest employer in your stateif a business is an individual like the courts say how does doing this not violate the first amendment they re being punished for their opinion by the government sounds like a massive lawsuit coming disney doesn t fuck around when it comes to lawyersi know they won t but i hope disney decides to dump florida it would be insanely expensive but i d love to see them move to another state impact tourism employment taxes it would really mess with florida s economypunishing for what their ceo said publicly using his freedom of speech per the first amendment the government ca do that however the bill is watered down from last year it a punishment in name onlywhich part of small government is thisso when are we going to take over the mega churches and start taxing themit not a small govt world after alli not gon na shed a tear over the potential of disney losing money but it so obvious this is just some culture war bullshit being pushed by rsdisney is going to leave florida but i imagine there going to be a lot of money poured into blue politics in floridahow about that party of small government get ready for higher taxes osceola and orange county have fun with thattoday the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end he said at a bill signing ceremony in lake buena vista there s a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the republicans we love letting corporations do whatever they want unless they do something we don t like then we hate letting corporations do whatever they wantah yes the party of limited governmentand this fucker wants to run for presidentwe need small government meanwhile at the legion of doomoh god he really said the phrase there a new sheriff in town fucking lameno one has ever been able to convince me of the dangers of big government more than ron desantisand republicans actually want this prick to be our president let s not fuck around with the 2024 election guys i don t care if you think biden s too old he s exponentially better than this piece of shiti all for screwing corporations but any republican who backs this needs to take a very close look in the mirror there is literally nothing stopping a governing body from just taking your property and this sets even more precedentconservatism has become antibusiness and pro big government what a time to be alive lmaoah yes the folks getting involved and taking over a of social issues that don t even effect them personallyso the government is punishing disney for expressing their opinion anyone else catch this or remember the first amendmenti am still having problems telling the difference between and the talibanwe re punishing people and corporations just for voicing opposition to government policies we re becoming more like the former soviet union every dayi hope disney is secretly putting in place plans to relocate out of florida if they re lgbtq friendly they shouldn t operate in a hostile environment like that anywaypunishing disney by taking on billions of its debt that show themsmall government at workmy guess is this will be overturned in the courts but maybe disney does want to go that route and will just let dictator ron and the gop pay for all the infrastructure in the disney district and let the good people of florida pick up the tab ends up being a win win for disney however if disney wants to go to war with dictator ron they could just close the parks for the hot summer months saying it too hot during the summer months to open up and for the health and welfare of our employees and guests we will close between memorial day weekend and labor day weekend and they can cut into the states finances in a bigly way and this will have a trickle down effect into the states other tourist attractions do this for a couple years and dictator ron will be crawling on his knees begging disney to open back updoing the things people want price of food making you nervous desantis will help by punishing disney inflation out of control desantis will attack trans people cost of living too high desantis bans critical race theorythis doesn t punish disney as much as it punishes floridai hope we have a leopards ate my face moment after desantis realizes that disney could close it all down and relocate to another state and never feel the pinch financially he would be left to clean up the mess and explain why so many jobs were lost and why such a huge source of income left the statepiss off the company that provides billion in tourist revenue and damn near half a million jobs for the state that ll go welleveryone afraid of trump being elected again but the real danger is desantis winning the man is already acting like a dictator with the support of the republican partytoday the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end he said at a bill signing ceremony in lake buena vista there s a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the ah yes the gop party the ones that are always accusing democrats of sticking their nose into the private sector to be socialist bullies are always the ones sticking their nose into the private sector to be socialist bullies seriously today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end if that came out of the mouth any else in the government every single gop member would be foaming at the mouth screaming socialist communist at the top of their lungsthe republican party is the party of government overreachhow is this not a clear 1st amendment violationthis will cost florida taxpayers a fortune all the infrastructure and services provided by and paid for by disney in the district are now the state responsibility what a price to pay for not being criticized for policy oh by the way disney can still criticize policy they just have fewer responsibilities while doing itwell you know how republicans are all about small government and always insist on a approach to business ohas impossible as it is it would be great if disney just said f you and moved to another statebecause the smartest decision is always to piss off the billion dollar business in your backyard that does billions in tourism for your state every year yup smart movevindictive littleimagine how rapidly florida would go shithole country if disney just leaves this guy sucks on so many levels but the whole messing with disney thing is so stupid it s painfulokay for those wondering this bill does not remove the self governing district it being renamed from reedy creek improvement district to central florida tourism oversight district the bill removed disney ability to make an airport stadium and nuclear power plant without the approval of that 5 member board essentially their only job disney retains control over roadways utilities and essentially every other project besides the three listed above why is it like this because if desantis actually removed it orange and osceola counties taxpayers would have to pay off the billion bond debt disney has and it would put another 200 million annual burden on taxpayers to maintain disney infrastructure would that be possible for the counties no so they would have to get state government financial aid meaning desantis would forcing all floridian taxpayers to pay for disney infrastructure that would not be a good look for him and his do say gay supportersi know it would be a crazy strategy but disney should just shut down the park indefinitely pay property taxes and thats it no income so they have no business tax to contribute to the state that would result in thousands of newly unemployed people a couple billion in collateral loss of tourism and several hundred million dollars in lost tax income they could reopen a couple months after they vote desantis out and negotiate a return to the original plan for disney s independencefunny how a government intervention takeover of private business is going to register at all with the miami cuban voting blocdeletedi hate the mouse as much as the next guy but i a bit excited about dumb shit desantis taking them on disney has destroyed people for far less it a bold strategy cottonhang the fuck on ai republicans all for small gov and true free markets and minimal taxes how is taking over a company even in the way described here considered worthy of celebration for their basei have a fairly strong feeling that the house of mouse is gon na bite him in the ass come election seasonthis is closest i ve seen post ww2 of any american politician seizing the means of production if you get my driftevery time i ve read about this the cause of this change was to punish disney for taking a critical stance of a law so it seems really like political retribution instead of good reason law and for the cherry on top ron appoints himself to pick the committee and then picks 5 people that donate to him it seems really like political mafiaso if i get this right republicans are and want to deregulate and give tax breaks to like disney unless they feel that is a word you can say in which case it big government for them yessir this is a taste of the kind of inane timewasting these utter tits will do if they get near the presidency againthey are literally saying that they are vgoing to undermine and try change the bills that the elected government was passing so they took away some of the privileges they were getting from the government they were politically fighting you almost got it please reread what you wrote as you are so close disney has the right to do what they are doing governments do not have the right to retaliate against them i think i ve read that somewhere congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievanceskrazy kristian konfederates love making everything toxiclet s see what the power of megacorp disney can do if this maga douche pokes it too muchso florida just going to assume all that debt huhlook i hate capitalism as much as the next guy but i m pretty sure big businesses aren t going to sniff anywhere near florida if this is how they can be treatedlet s just remind everyone what started all this disney decided reduce their regular donation read protection money to the republican partyif citizens united taught us that corporations have 1st amendment rights it seems to me that disney has a a prima facie to say that fl is restricting their free speech by overtly punishing thempunishing disney with a giant tax break a giant subside he punishing the people of florida with a huge tax bill on top of his draconian ideologyyou realize disney could simply say fine we are closed until desantis retires and desantis would be gone pretty quickwho controls the taxing district is probably not a huge deal the board will understand that harming a huge employer is a bad idea and disney will figure out a way to work with the board in order to continue making money what should worry everyone regardless of political affiliation is government using its vast power to punish someone over a policy disagreement anyone that believes what desantis and the republicans are doing here is ok does actually believe in the principles of this nationyes small government letting a business do what it wants wait whatare people in florida not concerned with how thin skinned desantis is between banning books masks cooking covid numbers stripping educational funding when he doesn t like something and meddling in private business he s not for small government or freedom at all only the freedoms he agrees with which isn t how america workswhat happens when disney suspends all film and tv filming within florida that s a lot of jobs within the industryi could give a flying fuck about what happens at disney but this is going to kill florida economy businesses generally trust that the state wo shake things up to this extent even if disney does leave a lot of companies will reconsider moving jobs into a state where the governor will pettily walk back on promisesthe irony of the party that is for less government involvement is promoting more government involvementrepublicans love big governmenthis book is about freedom i do think that word means what he thinks it means oppression is a synonym for freedomdisney should pack up and leave floridadisney should move every single necessary corporate function from that district asap close that segment of the park and leave all the buildings empty pending redevelopment offer all employees who want it a relocation to other facilities or parks worldwide and just slash the tax base for that district do it fast and add on all possible actions that will drain local state funds make desantis look like a complete idiot while making sure the local national press cover it the entire time oh and give buckets to every possible democratic candidate in floridagovernment control like this is usually labeled fascism or socialism it all depends upon the speaker definitely not free enterprise as we know it was disney going to sue florida for billions regrds thissure let s upset the major company that employs a significant amount of people rendering floridians jobless and destitute typical politicians unaffectedmark my words he going to be worse than trumpwhy the fuck do they care so much about disney i swear to fuck if they put a fraction of their energy into real shit we might make it to the 22nd century but that really not looking likely nobody has any goddamn foresight not that you need to worry about the future when all your money is in the present self serving pieces of shitspoiler alert disney wins in the endthe one thing that tells me just how much of a this is is the lack of a lawsuit by disney to prevent it government taking action against a private company in retaliation for the content of its speech pretty clear first amendment violation therei am so tired of desantis political posturing and culture war bullshit i want to throw up any time i hear a middle aged white dude repeat the word ad nauseum i think here in my parts todd rokita learned that from desantisdisney will litigate this garbage until desantis is a failed presidential candidate and no longer governor then when they win the lawsuit and reduce the oversight board to nothing no one will remember thiscan t wait for this clown to show up with giant cartoon all over him the mouse is gon na have a field day with this fucking moronthis guy got married at disney lmaodisney should just buy floridathe republicans always claim to be pro business until that business doesn t represent their values they re all hypocrites and yet idiots still keep them in officeit annoying disney punishing the county who now has to foot the bill disney footed for decades that like caving in your skull to spite your faceit would be hilarious if disney pulled out completely and left them a rotting citythe florida republican party vs disney as a floridian i hope they both lose somehow both are evil organizationsthe creation of the district was instrumental in disney s decision to build near orlando in the 1960s the company had told the state it planned to build a futuristic city that would include a transit system and urban planning innovations so the company needed autonomy in building and deciding how to use the land the futuristic city never materialized and instead morphed into a second theme park that opened in 1982i wonder if this is why that super bowl ad said i m going to disneyland instead of disneyworlddenazi is fucking around only a matter of time till he finds outthis kinda sounds like communismdesantis gettin ready to announce song of the south 2disney just needs to move its operations to ga coast or louisiana and kiss this mf goodbye then see if he can ever win another electionin reality it not much of a punishment it just sturm und drang to keep his voters thinking he a badassdesantis has replaced trump in the news cycle every damn be careful that s how trump was elected media gave trump free national advertisement every day leading up to election day desantis is smarter than trump and well aware of the national media helping electionswhy do i feel like disney is on the short list of companies that could get away with assassinating a sitting president if they were truly motivated to do soi just realized that asshole fucked two counties with this stunt disney no longer has to pay that billion dollar bondhow smart is it to attack the states biggest employerreligion has no bloody place in governmentleave it to republicans to get triggered at a company thay literally turned some worthless piece of shit wasteland into a goldmine generating endless amounts of tax revenue they would never get on their own deathsanta is a fool to go and bite the hand that feeds himpurely coincidentally the dimwitted villian in the next disney movie is named ronda santisall the taxpayers should thank him for the gigantic bill he knee jerked them all into owingfor some reason i see disney taking all all of this grand standing in stride and then suddenly in the heat of the presidential race desantis run falls apart for a seemingly unrelated reason he s messing the biggest media and best story telling company in the world not a smart enemy for a presidential candidateso just remember if he president and your state pisses him off you can expect similar treatment even if you kentucky or mississippimess with the mouse you get the ears dont cry when this goes sideways on you traitordesantis is the human equivalent of underwearcan t wait for the financial might of disney to just crush ron defascistdisney should just shut down the park and move to another statedesantis takes over disney district punishing tax payersi m still surprised he got away with such a clear violation of the 1st amendmentbecause nothing says socialism better than a total government takeoverfloridians are going to get woken up when their taxes go up with this desantis moveanother example of smaller governmentbrought to you by the party of small limited government and economyso by desantis logic government is better than business til desantis was a socialistdesantis is going to financially ruin florida and then his base will somehow rationalize blaming it on the leftyou guys should never let this man be president ever he dangerousdesantis is all for big government running every school business or person who does not agree with him much of disney world resort is in southwestern orange county with the remainder in adjacent osceola county the property includes the cities of lake buena vista and bay lake which were governed by the reedy creek improvement district the areas maintained by reedy creek district were heads and shoulders above oseola county areaswhen is desantis going to be punished for his fascist behaviorthings have gotten so strange with desantis it s like another world once scotus changed the gop extremists came out from under their rocksthe state of florida got what it voted for good and hardwife of a chairman son of a mayor and head of a church im sure they have more credibility than just that it leaves the district and its financial abilities and debt obligations intact addressing a chief concern of surrounding governments it also prevents people who have worked with or contracted with a theme park in the past three years from serving on the district s new governing board at his news conference desantis said he would appoint tampa attorney martin garcia as the chairman of the district s new governing board along with new board members bridget ziegler a conservative school board member and wife of the florida republican party chairman christian ziegler brian aungst an attorney and son of a former republican mayor of clearwater mike sasso an attorney and ron peri head of the gathering usa surely disney has deep enough pockets and influence to make this go away right this is just punishmenthas this been discussed can disney world move to another state this would take years but considering it is going to be majority red for years to come this may be the right move long termseems like an extravagant waste of government energy and resources to stroke the governor ego the citizens of florida gain nothing from thisthis is the headline desantis wanted the allusion of punishment while the people who would never vote for him understand it punishment in name onlythis guy should not have power in governmentah the presumptive republican frontronner behaves like a wannabe despot autocrat no big surprise therethe state just took on an extra 1 billion in liabilities ai no winners heresure sounds and government to piss off your largest state employer second to funeral servicesgovernment overreach because their values conflict that peak rethuglicanso much for republicans

idiot to complete piss off your breadwinnerwhy are conservatives mad at disney i can t even remember what it was but desantis is apparently still upsethe ca make up his mind whether he for or against government overreach and abuse of powerpunishing company by passing on billions of their debt to a local towni no fan of disney but that motherfucker is about one head too talli know it probably not possible but disney ought to shutdown and move otherwise bend overah yes the party of small government tmchild trafficking wan na be dictator throws hissy fit because the company that keeps his state

caresthe bill isnt a punishment for disney they just got gop babysitters now the rcid that will working akin to a teenager who is on their phones the whole time not paying attention until the parents voters come aroundfuck with the mouse get the big ol white glovethese damn democrats and there big government policiesi really am starting to hate this man and all politicians wtf did they get off trying to tell us how to live our lives u know they all broke every rule they are shoving down our throats bunch of hypocritesso much for the party of limitedi do think disney is ever going to forget this and will wait for the perfect moment to drop whatever dirt that billion dollar company dug up with their unlimited resources that mouse could transform into wolverinethe party of free market and free speech in a capitalist society ladies and gentlemen this is why i no longer a republican along with that shit ton of other reasons but you get my pointnanunless your job requires you to post on or monitor social media such as if you work in public affairs then you should be using any social media on your government devices do that shit on your personal devicesshould be a ban on all social media apps on government devices that why you have a personal cell phone laptop tablet in the private sector you get in trouble for using work devices for personal shitof all social media platforms why would anyone working for government agency havetiktok on their government deviceif it is not a personal device then you should have anything but business related apps approved by said business you know like the rest of the employer devices average people use for workboth canada and the us banning tiktok on the same day australia has also begun to ban it for various federal departments as well if the kiwis and brits ban it then clearly something was found through the five eyesmakes sense if they re arguing it is chinese malware then of course it shouldn t be on federal deviceswe had mdm software on any company provided cell phone that blocked installation of almost all apps outside of an approved list especially social media and things like tiktok and that was a medical company surprised it not more common especially with government devices they said tiktok is chinese spyware for how many years nowfacebook twitter youtube etc are banned on government devices by being blocked as social media not really news30 days any mdm solution should be able to do this in 5 minutesfrankly most lower level federal government officials should not have any social media on their work phones with the exception of those involved in public relations for their departments high profile leaders of departments will have things like twitter to communicate on issues but they are another exception the rest don t need it on government devicescanada following suit nowbut then how are army supposed to drive up recruitmentshould been a nationwide ban on that spy applong overdue in fact why has it happened until now was even trump talking about doing this back when he was in chargetiktok should be on any devices why that spyware is so popular i never understand tiktok tracks so much of your data it makes facebook look like a creepy guy in a vanfederal employee here i would be caught dead with any social media anything on my work device which is why i am mindblown by the fact that there are stable geniuses in my agency sauntering through the workday with fucking tiktok and taxpayers financial on the same phone the chinese government blackmails federal employees to do its bidding having tiktok is like playing russian roulette with a semiautomaticthey lied and were caught i think banning it outright is the only right option set the stage for future foreign apps also why was social media already banned on government devices aside from some allowed whitelist and why were they locking the phones downbetter than nothing although we should ban it from the country altogether beccause it owned by the chineseban it altogether useless app that ruins a generationthe only reason the government really wants to ban tiktok is because it s the most effective organizing tool on the internet i heard about the train explosion in ohio a week before the mainstream news media mindlessly reported the government and corporate talking points all this talk on national security is fucking horseshit america endlessly hacks everyone in the damn world but apparently it s ok when we do it bad when anyone else does itare there really no adults in the room anymore mass shootings no universal healthcare roe v wade overturned sedition and treason in congress children going to bed hungry voters rights being violated racist acts committed hourly poc fear for their lives etc and they all agree on this issue wtftiktok is great for what it is but i agree with this theres no reason to have it on government devicesit shouldn t be on devices sheeshi agree that tiktok probably shouldn t be on government issued devices but it seems a little xenophobic targeting them specifically probably has way more data on more americans but they re still allowed on government devices they ll sell targeted ads based on that data to anyone willing to pay enough i know some positions require access to those platforms for various media reasons but the vast majority of government users don t need to be using them on their work devices work devices are for work personal devices are for whatever you wantit takes 30 days to uninstall a apptoo bad republicans would never support simple privacy laws for individual users data like europe did could solve this easily it my data therefore i should own itwait can they do that without a specific law allowing it from congresswho installed tik tok on their government devicewhy so long security threats to tech in most companies i ve worked for give 48 hrs to complywho using tiktok on their government work phones wtfalmost all companys have all social media or similiar sites on company devices in my company and its one of the biggest here in germany i ca even open email provider websites others than the standard company onetik tok is bad except when we invite tik tok celebrities to the white housethis is gon na come down as a tasker when 90 of the responses are going to be done no changes needed very very few fed devices will need to require any changes in network policy and for the rest it likely just trigger a device upgrade or change that was likely coming soon anywayi always wonder if these articles are honey pots for people to admit that they re government employeesthe ban should be for federal employees period not just federal devices i not familiar with what permissions tiktok asks for but if it microphone camera contacts and more than you could easily share sensitive info without knowing itdeletedwhich compels a question we know the conservative mantras are projection which means a nearly ubiquitous app is actively generating more data than could be analyzed for american intelligence so who is itnani m going to escape to this country because i enjoy the benefits of its corruption this country is corrupt and i don t agree with its justice system ha fuckin ha ha ha hasay what you want about andrew tate but the dude is living proof that going to romanian prison for human trafficking can in fact be very funnydude better just wrap his mind around the fact he going to be detained until his trial dateon the a lot of new romanian news reported that they wiretaped tate in jail and monitored a lot of his phone converstations 1 he planned to flee to dubai if he would get released on house arrest he told his cousin to plan the escape for the same day he had the 30 day hearing so he could directly flee to dubai his cousin luke also contacted some sheikhs andrews lawyer defense to these accusations today was that he did not want to flee but simply go to a doctor in dubai quick because of health problems which would have been 2 he ordered a friend of him to intimidate the witnesses and file huge defamition lawsuits for 20 million so they would get afraid and drop the charges 3 he also also instructed his cousin luke to pay women so they defend him online and even come to court and defend him and put on a fake show so now that just proved their point that the detention is right and if they would let him out he would just intimidate witnesses or flee the country sources https https edit if anyone ca translate the articles you can use chrome on your

comical to mea real alpha male would punch their way through their prison bars and fight their way outi go ahead and proactively approve the 4th and 5th extensionhe is an alpha male with alpha juice oozing outta his ass in the romanian prisonbless romania you love to see iteven this article title is meant to let him of the hook romania oks 3rd extension of accused human trafficker andrew tate is much more objective and less likely to build sympathy because of his status as an internet celebwhat is stop there let s go for a bakers dozenin what fucked up reality is a rapist and a human trafficker described as an influencerhe always looks confused is that what alpha isquick reminder to recycle your pizza boxesandrew is currently fighting ghosts in his celllooks like he got a few more weeks to work on those chin exercisesgood keep him there he s a flight risk lolromanians taking out and putting the trash where it belongssounds like he is stuck in a traffick jamthe four suspects appear to have created an organised crime group with the purpose of recruiting housing and exploiting women by forcing them to create pornographic content meant to be seen on specialised websites for a cost diicot said in a statement andrew tate is like if oj released his book about how he killed his wife while he was killing his wifea romanian court on monday upheld a third detention for the divisive influencer and former professional kickboxer andrew tate who is held on suspicion of organized crime and human traffickingthat s a high t male hairline if i ve seen one what a chadand he has no internet cant tell everyone how wonderful he ishe looks like his breath stinkshis face is just so so bad i not normally one to judge by appearance but he just so damn hideous like a slackjaw smeagol or somethinga prison riot couldn t happen to a better candidatewhy is he handcuffed to a clone with better hairi love that the only new news about him lately is yup still inall because he couldn t let a snarky tweet from a teenage girl go because his ego is so fragile he had to run her over in his boogah ee metaphorically speaking the ratio of fuck around to find out is simply fucking staggeringjust remember anyone who claims that it s hypocrisy or that tate doesn t deserve being detained without charges is forgetting one key thing with tate detained all the women he was detaining against their will are free releasing tate will put the freedom of women in jeopardy charges or no the man s imprisonment is keeping women from being kept against their willit better for the environment to keep him locked up so he not out driving all those carshe should rot in prison for the remaining of his for ruining so many livesbut he was so convincing that he would fly to dubai for a check up and come backwhy is dane cook in the pictureromanian rule of law makes a mockery of the american rule of law when it comes to human trafficking too bad epstein wasn t caught in romaniai m so glad he wasn t arrested in the us this is funcalling him an influencer undermines the sex trafficking he has doneon the one hand this is very funny and he absolutely deserves it and he made his own bed to lie in and it could have happened to a bigger shithead however on the other hand something else i guessin a cell or now an incelgood keep him locked up guy never deserves to see the light of day human trafficker pedophile rapist misogynist and more as well as trying to instill that into children nonetheless as well this guy is evillol i can see that andrew didn t invest in a new hairline like his brother did bald bastardsfuck this guy in particularcan anyone with more than a passing familiarity with the romanian legal system tell us if this is significant that is what sort of crimes would get bail or whatever it is called in romania what sort of crimes would not get bail is this unusual or is it pretty normal for example i suspect in canada he would have gotten bail he would have had to put up some vaguely notable surety but unless they could show some evidence that he was going to flee he would have probably gotten it even in this serious a case as he would have gotten a good lawyer and he could put up a good surety they might have insisted upon a passport surrender in the states he also would probably have gotten bail but it might have been really large and they would definitely order a passport surrender what i hoping to hear is that this sort of detention is unusual and shows just how big a he isyou think with all his money and how vain he is he would got hair transplantsi feel bad for the poor ghost in the cell with him perpetually terrified of being annihilatedhaha dumb fuck probably not feeling so top g about thisnow taking bets he keeps telling the guards he leaving the country the second they let him out of his cellone looks like he s in the taliban the other looks like a phony watch salesmani just pray they dont get acquitted that would give them so much of a storylinegood keep that pedo therecan i stop hearing about every bowel movement this dickhead makesi would mind him staying in jail forever but is this normal processlock him up in a deep dark hole and throw away the keyi wish people would understand that shitting on someone for being bald isnt acceptable just because they a shitty person other bald people will read your comments guyshe s definitely looking like he was bald by choiceandrew tate as a prison ghost influencer wasn t on my 2023 bingo cardbeen a fun past few days for obnoxious internet celebs jake paul lost to tommy fury of all people imagine losing your first real boxer test and it to freaking tommy fumbles and now thisi guess those icy chills he was tweeting about foretold this extensioni am sort of confused with the romanian legal they can hold you in jail while they are investigating they don t do the already have finished the investigation part before putting people in jailyo his hair is growing back nicethis asshole has made many enemies that s what he s good ati got ta say it s cool when karma works so fastkeep him from what i have learned of him he s a real posy all don t have to keep extending it artificially no one else wants him he can rot in a cell forever if you just magically lose the keyi think step one of your plan to subvert the justice system through bribery and corruption should have probably been not telling them about your plan al capone did this and that was decades before the release of unrelated belgian pump up the jamlove that s he s balding and looks like shit this is a great thing that happens once a month this pos is still in jailthey toying with he did wanted to go there for corruptioni hope i hear about these extensions until he deadandy taint is getting out any time soon he already signaling he been dating while in there i bet he does want to leave his new significant others he in solid plural relationship now such a studthe guy fucking sucks but that sweatshirt looks comfy as fuck thohaha he s an influencer nowcould they please also get him off twitter so we can forget about himi know this guys a piece of shit but do they actually have any evidence on him this is the third extension and they ve yet to present anything incriminatingi admit this is getting a little questionable they should charge him with a crime if he s a flight risk and he is then deny him bail after he s formally charged but you shouldn t just leave someone in jail indefinitely because he sucks that s a terrible way to do things there s a process even in our shittiest states we have to charge someone or let them go after a few daysnanscott adams claims the dilbert tv show was cancelled in 2000 because he was white in fact the dilbert tv show was 167th in the ratings which was the very lowest rated tv show on nbc fox abc cbs wb network and upn there was not a single show that averaged a lower rating across those 6 major networks than dilbert the only network that had lower rated shows than dilbert was pax if any network exec in 2000 would have kept the lowest rated tv show on the air they would have deserved to be firedtomorrow s headline musk to purchase dilbert distributorto those wondering adams said based on the current way things are going the best advice i would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people on his youtube channelhis tweets about this and the replies something elsei just looked through his twitter feed only an hour ago he was retweeting remarks about why does no one ever talk about the slave owners that treated their slaves well and he saying that everyone agrees with what i said i think he truly going through denial right nowscott adams descent into craziness had underpinning 20 years ago the last book his i read 20 years ago the dilber principle had an epilogue where he was advocating for explaining reality in totally different way than how people and even scientists see it ok interesting idea lets see where it goes he first states the you can gravity not as a force but a consequence of everything getting bigger so when you jump up off the earth you back down not because the east attracts you but because you and the earth both are constantly getting bigger now i think he makes it clear that is only an example and that he actually does believe this the actual cause of but he seems overly proud of himself like he is some great thinker that somehow this can mimic most of the effects of gravity except according to this logic satellites could orbit the earth they would quickly spiral to the ground or the moon for that matter but ok this was just an example to get the reader to think creatively about reality nothing wrong with that but then he says based on the previous mode of thinking he is going to go out on limb and think that evolution will eventually be proven false he says he has no explanation why its wrong and what will replace it just basically that he is a big brain as the gravity example showed youhe ll be on the lecture circuit how to implode you career and legacy in 4 lines by scott adamsbout damn time he s been an insufferable prick for ageswhat struck me is when he said he wakes up checks his feed and sees black people beating up white people every day does he know how these feeds work he got radicalized by the algorithm probably always racist but went extreme when the algorithm kept giving him what he wanted to seelittle did scott know but he was the pointy haired boss the entire timethe funniest thing about this was elon immediately coming to his defense and instantly smearing the media and then later deleting those postsscott adams has had issues for years so these consequences are a coming he killed his public speaking career by providing hot political takes in 2016 https he got dragged for using a tweet about the gilroy garlic festival shooting to promote his app https if you look at the views on race https section of his wikipedia entry and the fact that he has a views on race section in his wikipedia article is a huge tell you can see adams history of saying something racist or insensitive under the guise of being edgy and flushing valuable portions of his legacy down the toilet if anyone asked me i d say seriously scott adams what are you getting out of all this are you a social psychologist who spent decades studying racism https are you optimizing the dysfunctional ecosystem of social justice by learning from legitimate academic experts and using your platform to advocate for best practices no of course not you re a trained hypnotist https and you bounce between health issues and bad relationships like a flea on a hot skillet one would think your life experience would teach you that you don t have it all figured out and maybe you should spend some time listening instead of talking but hey it s your that s what i would say if scott adams asked me but he isn t asking me and i m all the happier for itthis is one of those things that locals could see coming he s been a known dick for a while here maybe not a hyper conservative racist dick but a dick back when i was growing up my dad loved dilbert so when scott adams opened a restaurant and affiliated with a coffee shop he d visit daily only minutes away i wondered why my dad never went turned out scott adams was such a dick that him being there daily was a bad thing the was on par with other local places but he himself was such a dick that people didn t want to go there the people that had lived locally and knew his reputation didn t want to go in the first place and those that went found him too abrasive to come back i swear the local and national news fluff pieces dilbert fans and the people who didn t know the affiliation were how it stayed open so longhilarious that rasmussen makes a poll intended to enrage conservatives and then it makes conservatives nosedive on social mediahe s been saying super racist shit for 20 years i don t know why this was the thing that crossed the line he should ve been dropped decades agobecause scott adams is a master persuader and predictor who has never been wrong about anything he already pivoted to claiming this is all part of his master plan lmaosigh throw xkcd 1357 at scott and tell him to shut the fuck upalso he is trying to start a rather shitty race war around the really biased rasmussen poll and it s weird race baiting questions but alas a revolutionary he is piece of human trash he dilbert has become no better than his mastersscott adams said i moved to a predominantly white neighborhood because of this this being a poll that came out five days ago i didn t see any moving boxes in the videowe need to create a new cultural darwin award based on the original darwin awards the darwin awards of course are for people who remove themselves from the gene pool cultural darwin awards would be for people who remove themselves from the culture through their own efforts earlier winners would be cat stevens will smith and kanye westadams has been homophobic transphobic and racist for quite a long time years at the very least i disappointed that it took this long and such a blatant display of racism for him to face consequencesthey knew for years they he suckedcoming soon fox nation s comic strip pageoh look it the consequences of my actionsthe individual papers would hurt him but losing his major syndicator will i suppose he is ready to retire and can hang out with pillow lindell and others of their same mental persuasionbaffles me in this day and age regardless of what the hell your opinion is that people haven t learned to keep their mouth shutover his racist remarks try his 3 racist ah aim aliaseswhenever i see that someone is catching flack for remarks i like to withold immediate judgement untl i see what they said kinda of an internal i be the judge of that then i read what he said holy hell dude flipped out over a poll ran by a conservative group that you already know is going to be skewed there millions of blacks in america he just judged all of them over a poll that maybe talked to 800 people and probably out oc context he did just jump up and change who he was over one poll it been brewing and he s just been waiting for an excuse to speak his mind glad that he was able to excercise is right to free speechis dilbert one of the 350 books that florida kids are allowed to readthis guy to whom no one asked him for his opinion will be a host on foxcanceled please it called consequences for supporting segregation in 2023 this is remotely related to cancel culturetrading out the white collar for the white hoodnow he free to team up with gina carano on a new project80 years from now the will erect a dilbert statue and 160 years from now cat human hybrids will tear it downtil that newspapers were still running the dilbert comic stripadams absolutely deserves everything he getting but i really wish there was more of a spotlight on rasmussen fuck them for coming up with these bs polls designed to mislead and gin up controversyi wonder scott adams realized he is a public figure in a way and loose tongue can be deadly well he does nowyea if you have heard scott adams outside of his cartoons this is not surprising hes known for having very flawed opinions about many things and he tends to voice them whenever he gets a microphoneon the plus side he is considering taking legal action against equally insane cartoonist ben garrison that would be a show to watchactions have consequences and adams is learning this he s part of the problem and so is charlie kirk who s decided to follow adams s examplehad anybody actually seen the original video it s on youtube it s basically him talking for 5 some minutes about various topics i had to search around but i had always imagined him as a jolly fun loving guy becausenot surprised the dude who made that whack ass comic is a whack ass dudeif you do like society then you can just gggitoutthis ca be fixed because of people like me when chris rock called racism a mental illness he nailed it it is narcissism the root cause is narcissism think about what dilbert as a comic even was that shit was the mindy kaling of strips kinda funny until you realize that the character is just him and he is always always smarter than everyone in the room still now that adams has said what he said it s clear that the issue with dilbert is not just that the character is lazy and unmotivated and quite frankly characterization as the everyman victim now feels more nefarious it s worth considering not only how we will look back on dilbert and icons like the comic but how we can ensure that we do so more honestly httpsnow he have briebart and oan to publish his cartoonslet me guess he going to cry about free speech without any hint that he actually understands that this ism in no way a legal violation of his free speechhow did it take so long dude s been a rabid trump psycho for so many years now if you ve ever seen him speak he does that creepy smile talking that cult leaders do while he talks about trump being a genius and other q crap not really worth a very comic strip if you ask mei sure in a few weeks he sign with the babylon bee to publish new comic strips and they all just be dilbert standing there saying my pencil identifies as a calculator or some other variation of their one lame ass jokewell well well if it isn t the consequences of his ownno one going to be like you know he may be a bad guy but i just like dilbert too much to careso i ve had a dilbert comic up in my cubicle for a while because it was oddly specific about a function of my daily job usually i m completely checked out of the whole creator side of the media i ingest i couldn t name a band that plays the song i like or identify the actor who played whoever in that show i have always tried hard to separate the art from the artist mostly because i believe shunning something that made me smile only because i dislike the person that made the thing only took something away from me not the other way around but after listening to his rant i had to pull the strip off my wall and toss it dudes just trashi sure he become an crusader by the end of the week with a full calendar of speaking events at white supremacist rallieshe doubled and tripled down today by claiming he identified as black i lost three careers to direct racism so far crocker bank pacific bell and cartooning all three were perpetrated by white people for their own gain no black person has ever discriminated against me that partly why i identified as black for several years here httpsthe video he commented on was tremendously racisthe s got between 50 and 75 million net worth source quick google search and now he will become a poster boy for cancel culture nobody should ever feel sorry for this guy he made his bed and absolutely knew what he was doingthis is too bad scott adams has always been a piece of shit but dilbert has always been a rather on the nose bit of corporate i never read the strip daily or anything but there quite a few of the better ones i would like to repost to people always had to separate the art from the artist however and after the last couple years especially this was just a matter of time that he went too far for his distributorswhat a fool had one of the most successful comic strips ever but fame and fortune just weren t enough racist stupid fooldilbert was never that funny anywaywell at least adam s values his racism over his income have to at some level respect thatthe business world sure is funny is it well it funny when scott adams loses his jobthis dude has never talked to a black or brown person in his entire life lmfaothis is a great time to mention that scott adams couldn t talk to anyone but his cat for several years including his wifethe sun chronicle in attleboro massachusetts left a blank space monday where dilbert would normally run and said it would keep it that way through march as a reminder of the racism that pervades our httpsrule 1 of not being cancelled do be an assholeadams remarks were so racist his next move will be to run to become the 2024 republican nominee for presidentpeople like him are confusing cancel culture with consequences for their actions i guess that s what unchecked racism for decades gets you pushing back against it is finally mainstream and they can feel the walls closing inhow any rational human mind could make those remarks and see them as normal and not racist is just totally beyond me as matt binder said in response his view of black people is the view of a person who only interacts with black people through polls yep i not racist as a defense when you literally can not stand to be around a group totally checks outdilbert sometimes seemed like right wing nonsense to me so i stopped reading it twenty years agomy wife left now i far rightdo we think that this idiot is going to be the next ben garrisonit sucks because i grew up reading dilbert and scott books and i respected him the last few years he turned into a maga er and i do know what happened it sadi ve never once laughed at a dilbert comic this guy s a fuckin dweeb and his comics are midso he really catbertdude literally tweeted he considered himself black what a fucking nut jobi guess in a way i ve now met my hero and it s massively disillusioning and disheartening i ve spent a career following and referring to his cartoons as i work in a corporate world and to discover thiswhat does it ok to be white even means honest question from somebody who white if some polster was to ask me that question out of blue sky i be asking myself what hidden motives are behind such an open ended statement not to mention pointless statement if you look at the actual poll results a good chunk of respondents were along those lines they answered with unsure not with no because again what does that phrase even means well as with any open ended statement it means whatever the previous 5 questions in that poll wereadams and lindell will now join up for dilbert pillows and sheetsracists always get so upset when you call them racistoh no conservatives are being persecuted againamazing how conservatives never get it it not cancel culture it consequence culture no matter how many times they face the consequences of their actions the problem is always that they a victim somehow no matter how horribly they treat others that never the problemthis seems the first actual proper cancelling in a while the last time this came up for him was like a decade or longer ago but the expectations have changed a bit since then glad he felt the need to remind everyonefuture fox news contributor scott adamssix months max until there is a dilbert animated series on fox nationremarks it was a full on racist diatribeedit it really interesting seeing how contentious my comment appears to be as voting spikes up and down do people think i am defending him it is hopefully obvious that i not what exactly are you downvoting but not addressing in a comment what a shame i remember reading his blog a couple decades ago and really enjoying it but i stopped as there were signs around that time that he was going down some problematic rabbit holes he was an intelligent individual with interesting perspectives but we all need a support structure that can help identify and correct conclusions not sure how he gets out of this and sadly the storyline seems all too familiar where he will be embraced by extremists to further divide usi have felt this much schadenfreude since trump lost the election first tate getting arrested and now this it almost like life can actually deliver just comeuppances to some of those who most need to feel it sometimes yumyumyumyumyum gim me morenanthere s higher standards applied to where the stuff is shipped than to how it got therenorfolk southern should be responsible for every penny spent on nationwide cleanupthat should be easy identify all stockholders the board and executive officers divide the amount of waste by that number deliver the wasted to each of the above homesi mean what the hell did these people expect when they allowed epa waste disposal sites in their county are they usually notified about every single rail car going thereprobably going to an state that allows them to just dump it wherever they want free market fixes itselfthey re taking it the environment hopefully the front stays on next timei hope its the front doorstep of 1200 peachtree st ne atlanta ga with the rest of the garbagemaybe they can put it in garfield heights ohio they built a landfill in the 1970s where they dumped toxic waste closed it up years later without cleaning it up a developer bought it and put a mall on top of it the ground started sinking as gases escaped from the soil most of the businesses left it was reworked as a business park and is still open to this day did i mention the reason why they figured out the dump were toxic because a staggering amount of people were developing tumors people still live there shit is still messed up 50 years on and everything is business as usuali hear they store things atofficials with the environmental protection agency previously said they have approved the shipment of contaminated waste to two sites in ohio heritage thermal services in east liverpool and vickery environmental in vickery region 5 administrator debra shore said monday two more sites one in ohio and one in indiana will also receive waste from the derailment scene the move came after officials in texas and michigan complained they didn t get any warning that waste from the toxic crash site would be shipped to their states for disposal the epa ordered the train s operator norfolk southern to stop the shipments friday so that it could review the company s disposal plans lol seriously so their genius plan was to spread the toxic waste across the united states wonderful edit let keep track of where norfolk southern sends the toxic waste from their ohio train wreck site so far it has been public reported that at least 3 sites in oh 1 in in 1 in tx and 1 in mi have been sent waste knowingly and unknowingly ohio east liverpool oh vickery oh unclosed location in oh indiana unclosed location in in texas harris tx michigan belleville miso do move the waste to properly permitted and regulated disposal sites and just leave in east pallestine wtfand just wait for the first to pull all the contaminants down and percolate into the ground water not going to be goodwhy the concern the free market will sort this out as it always has the government should be meddling in the affairs of a free society or something equally comical spewed by conservatives prior to every fucking disasterso what happens when one of these shipments derail because apparently this happens all the timekeep it in ohio red states get what they getthere this golf course in floridaas the temps rise woodland folk retreat to the streams with their beer and children only to find dead crawfish and oily watergeez want it cleaned up or not haz waste worse than this is traveling by truck every day got to be hauled away somehowfunny east liverpool is like almost literally down the street from east palestine just a way for ns to save a few bucks on transportation costshm what are the odds they ship the contaminated stuff in another train and it derails againshould be norfolk doing the cleanup supervised by the epa and any other entity that regulates these environmental disasters and norfolk should have to be responsible for the processing and eliminating the contaminated wastenorfolk southern s train wreck site not ohio sapparently it s going to vickery and east other ohio towns which i m sure are thrilled to be getting ithow about mar a lago i mean all this would not have happened without the agent orange deregulationnimby also send some to trump and other politicians who allowed railroad companies to not be punished for cutting corner in matntenancethis planet is a closed system there is no easy answerit about time be concerned where it going where it has been going what will they do with it when they get there how long does it stay there does it stay there how long will it be there how much more will accumulate in one year time 5 years time 10 years time why do we create this product in the first place why ca we find alternative ways why do we continue to risk ourselves and the environment by constantly poisoning it ourselves and wonder why new diseases and cancers etc exist why do we realize that it everybody backyard no matter where we put it it might be 30 miles from your house but in a few years it be 10 mi from your kid house and one mile from your grandkids future house we got to get proactive and stop waiting for disasters to happen before we ask yourselves vital questions instead of worrying about the next ps5 black friday sale or how many likes for tick tock challenge or free crap because you think you an influencer or like some others who sit around and watch the boob tube all damn day morning news evening news drama and crime shows emotionally involved in pretend characters but completely oblivious of what going out on next door just mentally and emotionally exhausting to be raised to recycle and save the whales and decades later corporate companies finally gave in just to market green and it just got worse we know the solutions it takes work and lots of change and i not sure if that in the american vocabulary anymore it can be but even the best of us distract ourselves on a daily because we feel alone in the fight power in numbers myfor a start it is going deeper into the soil and into the creeks nearby you ca scream do something then complain when something is actually getting doneno shit day 1 i knew it would spread how many of you did too they knew what was in those cars from the start they knew many of the chemicals settle into the riverbed could they not have formed a downstream so only surface water flows and sediment gets captured scoop as they go good enough to have time to form a deep drainage pond and divert the river through there to form a buffer for waste removal or does this stuff just soak right into the water table either way those concerns should have been validated right away so the public can make safe decisions there still no transparency in all thiseeeeeyyy ohio pull on those nice big thick bootstraps and keep that shhht in your own statei feel like the guy in the picture needs more safety gearwhat the gov should is force them to get a 1000 year lease somewhere remote and safe in state have them dump it there and have them take care of it under strict supervision with spot checks and fines for any future harm to anyone or the environment for that time maybe they be more care in the future if they have a long term penalty possibility for cutting cornersthe mafia normally takes care of that and dumps it into the oceannanremoveddoes seem like many here are reading the article so i try to summarize as someone who really does know much about the law basically guy dealt cocaine and got caught his sentencing was a few years and about 75000 dollars returned which is different from fined which is what the officer bought it for problem is that he only really pocketed about 6 to 7k from that and as such does have the money to forfeit so instead of the forfeiture they fining him in lieu of him paying the fine they threatening more prison time his case is that the additional time due to the fine is unconstitutional because a fine in lieu of forfeiture is unconstitutionalare we really just going to ignore this under cover cop with a cocaine problemi mean his reason was pretty sound tbh lolit is government agencies deal more drugs than anyonesilly drugs always in the headlines but never any solution i propose we make them more illegal that will make people think twice about drugs if they are double illegal and then they will disappear from the earth and our kids will be oh so safeleave the small business owners alone alreadywait so the fine is the exact amount the cop spent on the cocaine sounds beyond reasonable to me means he can keep all the money he made on other sales also seems like to me buying cocaine should be just as illegal as selling it regardless of intent or badgepretty sure the constitution doesn t talk about cocainedeletedin vancouver probablymalcom gladwell writes that most drug dealers make less than minimum wage when all is said and donenanin total prosecutors believe that mr rumson spent only about 15 minutes in the capitol before leaving outside however footage shows that he encouraged other rioters to get a ram to breach another entry point the affidavit notes that he later assaulted at least one police officer by running through the crowd towards the officer reaching out grabbing the officer face shield which forced the officer head and neck backwards and upwards that s decidedly not very for shamehow is this an actual headline i feel like i losing my mind herei love how folks keep dropping dimes on these assholes according to court documents mr rumson was identified by the fbi after receiving a tip and reviewing footage that showed him putting on and taking off the panda mask while on his way to the capitol with his face in full view and he s gon na enjoy at least 2 years in federal prison for this stunt the affidavit notes that he later assaulted at least one police officer by running through the crowd towards the officer reaching out grabbing the officer face shield which forced the officer head and neck backwards and upwardsthat makes me a saaad panda not reallywow another florada manthis just sent a strong wave of fear into the traitors who have been caught yet the guy whose identity was completely hidden has now been caught only a matter of time until they arrest the next one i love that 2 years on and they are still arresting these dumb fucks just when they think they got away with it another arrest gets made public reminding them that they are still being huntedsad panda noises httpshe will have to bear the consequencesdo they provide a bamboo diet in prisonhe s a saaaaaaaad pandado be from florida do be from florida do be from florida sighcharged for a coup as impotent as a real pandai sort of see myself as a guy who keeps

shirt says 天滅中共 or tiān miè zhōng gòng heaven destroy the ccp i looked the phrase up online as i had heard it before and no surprise these shirts are available from the epoch times who as the propaganda wing of falun gong has been extremely supportive of the trump administration mostly because he and therefore the ccp the panda head must then be some kind of weak commentary on china but who has any idea what it could bewake me up when trump is cuffedi am proud of all of those people who were involved in arresting this guylots of people look like thatcan we get a sedition panda vs cocaine bear death matchno shortage of pond scum still on the lam https see if you can spot your kid pastor please review and sharea furry republican i guess furries really are all accepting my joke

harassment panda from south parki like how the january 6th coup attempt domestic terrorism event that aimed to end democracy in the us was planned months in advance by republicans and was only the final part in their otherwise soft legal coup attempt in the courts and yet media and history will forever recall the event as a riot what other types of riots were planned like this did the bbc or other news writers even watch the jan6 house committee hearings at allsend it back to chinasexual harassment panda from south parkchina called they want their panda backwait is this the cosplay subredditpandaman is really fucking everywherejust imagine rioting capitol wearing a panda costumewhen one little panda tries to overthrow the government after losing a democratic election that makes me a sad pandasedition makes me a saaaaad pandai woke up to this news this morning and cried tears of joy i hugged my children tight and whispered the good news into their ears they don t have to be afraid it is its overnanyeah this was a pretty big deal in my area students stood outside the school all day protesting for the administration to be held responsiblezero tolerance for bullying means and always has that the school does zero to stop it or help or supportas someone who was bullied relentlessly while growing up i think it long past time that organizations are accountable for creating a bully free environment including holding bullies accountable for the harm they dothat superintendent is still being paid but not working and the board refuses to comment absolutely revoltingtriantafillos parlapanides who was superintendent of the central regional school district at the time of the attack resigned a day after adriana s funeral services let not forget the school administration in thisit interesting that one was charged with aggravated assault and three were only charged with conspiracy to commit i guess one was dishing out the physical beating and the others were her up bullying seems like both the right and wrong word here i got bullied but it was relatively mild did feel good and there are a few moments in particular that i really wish i kicked up a fuss about instead of taking it but i walked away fine and used those moments later in life to become a more self assured person who wo accept any kind of mistreatment or harassment from men the boys in my class were the issue in my case but these bullies beat this girl into unconsciousness in the school hallway filmed it and posted the video of the assault in order to mock her she was covered in bruises and she actually blacked out that an incredibly violent assault why were they only suspended that should have been an instant expulsion and they should have been put in the hands of the police that same hour what a tragedyi feel like the student who posted the video should also be expelledmisleading headline and most people commenting did not read the article she was not charged with causing the suicide she and 3 others were charged with an assault a few days earlier that was posted online that likely contributed to the suicidei ve been bullied and beaten up all throughout elementary middle and the first half of high school the school liaison officer finally tried to help me in middle school but he moved after a short time and the bullying promptly resumed this time worse administration knew about it and did nothing the bullies parents knew about it and did nothing it was so bad that after high school i couldn t stand going back to my home town to this day i visit my parents and don t go anywhere in the community while there my bullies are all in jail for the most part but the emotional trauma that was done is too much my dream was to work in law enforcement in my home town and that was shattered i m honestly surprised that i didn t commit suicide because of my bullying and i m deathly afraid for my son who is only two to go to school and experience the same thing having lived through extreme bullying i completely understand the emotional distress this poor girl was experiencing the anxiety stress depression these kids that bullied her deserve way more than aggravated assault charges the administration that let this go on needs to be charged as well they all are responsible for this poor girl s death so very sadmy partner works in the high school system and these days regularly bully people online by taking pictures or videos of them then tagging them in the posting in order to generate more bullying i do think people realize how often this happens or how much this shit takes up the time of teachers guidance counselors and administration when they should be focusing on other things wondering why your meeting about your kids future was postponed look up the latest bullying drama on tiktok that took up your kids guidance counselor week seriously this may be the worst job in high school do go into it unless you are prepared to have worse mental health than your studentsi was bullied through middle school until about my junior year of high school i was always told ignore it so i did all that did was escalate things because it taught kids they could bully me with no repercussions so it never stopped i was the target every time because i did do a lot there were a couple times when i did go to the principal about it all he did was get the bullies in the room and he just said stop it that actually worked for about a week then they continued it was around the end of my sophomore year that something happened i was at the end of my rope one day during lunch i was eating and one of the regulars started up i snapped i took the milk he had dumped it on him grabbed his collars and head butted him in the nose which broke he did report it and no teachers saw it but other kids did i think he was embarrassed because it was me that kicked his ass after that i did get bullied very much the moral of the story is that if you being bullied fight back bullies are cowards and they trying to gain power over you they do usually have bad home lives so there that side of things too so i still dealing with severe mental health issues because of it anxiety depression ptsd etc yes i have ptsd from bullying but still fight back you may get suspended but look the principle in the eye and say any punishment you give to me right now is a far better fate than living with the pain and anguish throughout my lifethe scary part is how rotten the administration is that is trying to put the blame on the dead and her family rather than the one that caused the deaththese kids got it so hard these days i was bullied when i lived in nj but i got to get on the bus and go home and get away from it now you got social media you can t just go home and get away from it kids are so nasty to each other sometimes and they will simply keep going because they think it s funny they don t think about the real world consequences of their words it leaves deep life long scars i still deal with some of the consequences from bullying 20 years later there needs to be reform prosecuting the students isn t enough what about the administration that let this happen i m so sure they must have seen something no bullying just starts and rises to this extreme in a single day they had to have seen it and they chose to do absolutely nothing about it i know admin saw it happen to me i watched them turn their heads because he hits you because he likes you or she doesn t mean that don t take it to nobody deserves to go through the meat grinder that is bullying may this poor girl rest in peacebehind every bully i ever met were parents who either through malice or ignorance allowed their child to behave that way i not trying to mount a defense the kids in question but i do believe the parents should be free of blamei was very close to being in this young girl shoes when i was her age i attempted suicide several times turned to drugs but i managed to make it though it is disgusting this happened it is even worse that so many can relate to thisschools remind me of that family guy bit about cops sorry department policy we can t step in until it s too edited for typoi hear people say all the time kids are just soft that they got bullied and they came out ok well just like everything else times change you may have only seen that bully at school with social media there is almost no social decency and with that bullying can go on almost and from more people then ever before people make videos of them hurting other people for views and society enables itbut the people constantly reposting the video online making this poor girl relive her trauma every day get off scot freeif your kid is being assaulted call the cops criminal law does stop at school doorscharge the fucking parentsi was severely bullied in middle school towards the end i got in 3 fights in a matter of weeks of each other the school blamed me even though i was reporting harassment for months before because i was the one that kept getting into fights it didn t matter my bullies thought it was funny to sucker punch me i got more bullied for being a snitch my parents pulled me out of school and the school made it a pain in the ass to transfer because they claimed they were handling the situation they don t do shit they saw me as the problem i was annoying them with my constant whining school administrators don t give a fuck the system is incredible broken this shit will never stop until schools actually step in and throw bullies out of school zero tolerance for fights but they can destroy your mental health it s fuckedam i too pessimistic in thinking nothing will come of it at worst they will get a slap on the wrist because they are underaged they will learn nothing and likely do it againi was somewhat bullied in school but i was blessed with good teachers principle who took action i do understand why wo schools take action if it just a job to you then maybe teaching at a college is more suitablebeing bullied was some of the most painful stressful years of my life i ll never get back i feel so bad for this girl and i hope the school district is held responsible for doing absolutely nothing to protect herwhy does it seem like nowadays bullying isnt just a small group of assholes but half the school tearing you apart online every single day dedicated hate groups teachers that turn a blind eye how are so many of these kids so fucked up that they think this is okay social media should not he accessible by kids you should have to be 18 before you are able to use it same goes for any group chat apps that arent monitored by adults maybe then this online dogpile would stopmy future kids will be taught one skill swing after 1 full day of bullying or if the bully gets physical at all knock that fucker and their cronies the fuck out i will have your back i will not punish you i was bullied for 12 years i will not hear about or watch it happen to my kids let it be known my kids will fuck up any bully they encounter full stopthis is a sad sad sad news and may her soul rest in peace the students who stand around chanting filming verbally abusing the victim do nothing to help should be really ashamed of themselves and go seek forgiveness this needs to change and people need to step up when they see behaviour like this many other countries even have training now in work places speaking up via various means when you see inappropriate behaviour racism discrimination sexual inappropriateness etcremovedmy daughter has been bullied for years we are changing schools they do not care about bullying school never take action it s exhaustingas someone who was heavily bullied in nj public schools this doesn t surprise me at all i was blamed any time i would go to the teachers for help so i gave up trying had a really dark period where i tried to kill myself and couldn t go through with it i m so sorry for this poor girls life feeling that hopeless i want to believe she s at peace for her sake but so much of her suffering and others suffering is both needless and by the people meant to help young people grow and succeedi was bullied relentlessly for years in elementary school they would tease me incessantly calling me stupid until i snapped and hit someone then i get in trouble i got a brief respite in junior high then it started up again in high school peeing on my car messing with my water bottle in sports teasing acting like they fight me if i found out my kid was bullying someone i be incandescent with rage they would be so inundated with chores and volunteering that their social life would be scorched earthso the attack happened on a wednesday and she passed out with bruises but the police were not called and no ambulance was called only school safety officers dealt with it friday she killed herself i wonder if the school had called the police and assault and harassment charges had been filed against the attackers and if she had received medical treatment immediately instead of neglect by the administration which undoubtedly added to her trauma if she would have felt strong enough and supported enough and protected enough to continue with lifehappy to see some bullies finally being held accountable maybe my friend wouldn t have taken his own life at 14 if literally anyone in our school s administration would have listenedwhat about the teachers who ignored it it would be nice to see some adults get held accountable for their actions or lack thereof as welli was thinking as in someone said some mean things about her maybe someone pulled a nasty prank on them maybe this or that i was not expecting assaulted with the incident filmed and put online by the assailantsgood bullies are trash i don t want to hear the bullies are bullied at home nonsense either most are brats who have enabling parents the victim shouldn t suffer because the bulky lacks human basic human decencyas a former staff at an elementary school admin has done nothing to address the constant bullying that i see on a daily basis i continued to mention the issue to the counselor and teachers but they all shrug and say they just being kids certain school districts do care and it absolutely horrifying to seeit fucking tragic that the only reason anything is happening is two one a teenager took her own life and two that there was a video of the assault and there really is much being done at all some students being suspended and charged with assault an admin resigning and still being payed hell this school and district probably just wishes everyone moved on and forgot about the whole situation fucking bullshit and shitty humans everywhere in this situationabout fucking time bullying has actual consequences only took all of human history but we re getting therefor once a school bully is facing consequences for their actions i only wish more bullies had to face consequences for the pain they ve causedwe giving kids consequences for their actions now maybe i can go back to teaching soongood they should feel bad and take ultimate responsibility for their terrorizing behaviori wish kids knew how quickly school stops mattering when it ends it s such a small part of your lifethe public school system is a failure why are they continuing to try to teach those violent students with the nonviolent ones why cant they be separated why is this tolerated also why are the violent ones even off campus and outside school time allowed to continue their behavior our culture is so messed upwe had something in wall township last year thank god nobody died a video of a student being sexually assaulted in a football locker room by other players ended up on social media and it uncovered years of bullying in the school s athletic programs with coaches and teachers looking the other way it s a good thing that these things are being brought to light but why the hell do kids have to die or be raped before anyone talks about ita girl assaulted me and put the video online this was back in 2008 it made me suicidal having something like this happen to you can feel so isolating especially if your peers side with the abuser she was charged but barely got a slap on the wrist because she had rich parents a night in jail and an 8 hour anger management for premeditated assault because in the video she talks about beating me up and then doesamerica has had this bs notion of you have to learn to deal with being bullied why in my professional life that has never been in play and almost always we let go of these people why are they defended in school all the time they should be left with parents trying to figure out how they will be educated since they are no longer welcome at school instead of defending them i could care less if there were special schools just for delinquents and they got ta figure out how to survive there maybe then they actually work their way out but we behaved kids should not be dealing with those peopleshould been charged long before harassing another student to suicidehope she never gets another night of sounds sleep in her life idk how those kids can live with what they donegood i hope the bully rots piece of trash human beinggood let the bullies rot in jailschool administrators should be charged tooi was shocked when i moved a decade ago and the new high school there did believe in emotional bullying they said that if they arent throwing punches you are being bullied i knew that was bullshit even back then but it makes me think about the children who grew up in that system not knowing they are being abused people care and it is wrongthe very definition of too little too latei live in wisconsin and the high school 20min from my house has has 2 or 3 students commit suicide since last year due to bullying one of the parents made signs and a lot of businesses in the area put them up showing support but as far as i know the school administrators haven t done or said anything to prevent this from happening again to someone elsegirl kills herself for school releasing video to public so news outlets release video to more public in her honorhere s an idea charge these assholes before they bully someone to deathnot to be a complete asshole but given the responses of the majority of teens from countless videos on the internet concerning school fights or bullying where were these students currently protesting at at the time this girl was being bullied probably on their cell phones recording instead of stepping in and helping to stop it hold the administration accountable for whatever they may be responsible for but the student body that currently protesting could very well be just as accountable for their own inability to act when it was more needed in the moment and the proceeding days that came afterif i was her father i d have a hard time not hunting these pieces of shit down and avenging my daughterboyfriend should have let them hands loose male female or otherwise 4 vs 1 is 4 vs 1 got ta even the odds and drop a couple mean girls for a message sometimes this wasn t the first bit of bullyingi do understand why when it comes to kids 12 and up do get pressed with assault charges cause they beat someone on school property assault is assault why is it different from assaulting someone out of the school property police should always be involved when physical harm is done to someonethis is very wished someone brave enough was there to defend her at school and friends to rely on to counter against these worthless bullies i can t imagine how her parents must feelbullying is real i am almost 60 and the bullying in my elementary through 11 grade was unreal i dropped out and got my ged and then collegean example needs to be made of the kids who assaulted her in the hallway and of the school officials who did nothing about itthis is why a lot of schools are often shitholes most administrations couldn t give a rats ass about their studentsmight as well name the bulliesshould be more on the school for enabling ithold the parents of bullies accountable toogood in the past the schools and parents would take care of bullies since schools are too afraid of lawsuits and parents refuse to parent let these bullies get a dose of the real worldfor all you parents out there remember this stuff when you kid want a facebook account or a smart phone for that matter hoping it wont be long before there is a legal minimum age for all social media and it should be 18you get what you fucking deservemaybe if they get charged before someone commits suicide this shit will stopso sad as a father of 3 it s real these daysas if i needed another reason to become even more of a misanthrope i wish those students and the superintendent could be blacklisted from ever holding a jobyeah bullies should be held accountablegood in my case they tried to pretend bullies did exist and then began coaching and counseling people to abusivethey should be named i so sick of seeing this kind of shit and just having to make peace with the fact they are protectedi see the school superintendent resigned immediately because that will look better on his cv than being fired for doing nothing to protect that poor girli like to see the parents of those kids charged imagine raising a child to behave that wayshould parents be teaching their kids how to knock a mf out because schools do care about bullied victimsdealing with school administrators is practice for future dealings with cops human resources and any other person in a position of slightly elevated authority functioning under the guise of being there to helpnani i understanding this correctly but was she arrested for not leaving a medical facilityshe had a stroke before she knew the symptoms she knew she was having another stroke and would die without help they threw her out of the building like trash i think it is the doctor who medically cleared her who should be held liable for her deaththat da investigation also found that edward had been having multiple health issues leading up to her interaction with the police including a previous this isn t an excuse to evict someone from the hospital this isn t an excuse for the treatment of this person this is however a finding of guilt and failurethe cost of monetizing our healthcarei seeing all these threads saying yeah but they said she was alright so she was faking it she died in the truck she was alrightboth the hospital and law enforcement failed this woman i don t know if she s faking it or what but she s not answering he is heard saying as he lifts edwards head by the hair they couldn t even bother treating her like a human beingi live in the town where this happened the sheer number of folks who are victim blaming and praising the police response here has just made a little part of me die inside i watched the whole video and it s just horrifying without compassion and even a bare modicum of basic fucking and what are we she was treated as subhuman as a thing to be ridiculed and despised in the video it s really obvious that her coloring is way looks grey pale and is in obvious distressugh this woman should have been engaged by a caseworker in the hospital clearly the hospital wrote her off without properly diagnosing her symptoms if she has family this will be a wrongful death lawsuit against the hospital and the police they will win it the police abused her when the camera cut off there will be criminal charges too there might be manslaughter charges anyway but this is tennessee edit no physical abuse police callousness no charges for cops or hospital staff she died of a stroke as confirmed by autopsy she was showing symptoms of a stroke before she died and her family is suingwelcome to end stage capitalism dying ai good enough if you do have the moneymust have been awkward for the officers and hospital staff when they pulled back into the hospital the system is brokenmay her death be further proof of the need for universal healthcare as if any further proof was neededthat fact that police are even allowed to speak to people like that the fucking fact that they are thinking this way when they interact with people fucking fuck manfort sanders regional medical center good to know to stay the fuck away from therethis is so sad i can t watch seems some have lost their ability to be human and it starts with the people in healthcarei am so glad this is receiving national attention these clowns should get away with it the damage control is already in full effect kpd even released the video on their official social accounts acting like it would absolve them of wrongdoing and treating it like a winmost patient friendly american hospitalsecond video this week where the murder victim was right about what was about to happenthis is a nauseating video to watchhospital is still going to eat that lawsuit regardless you might not be able to sue the cops but there is video evidence of her stating her condition prior to leaving and i guarantee she told the hospital the same thingabsolutely horrific yet another example where a proper health care system would have saved this poor woman instead of pushing her off into law enforcement hands who of course picked the worst possible way to respond to herif she was faking a stroke she deserved an academy awardas a brazilian i envy a lot of stuff about usa but just thinking about your lack of healthcare makes my stomach churn we are a piss poor country and still we find the money to treat our people at least with some dignity our public hospitals are not 5 star facilities they are overcrowded and understaffed but most doctors would do their best to help this woman usa should be able to do better it a shame that you doas a european with public heathcare i would be so afraid to just live in the united states any injury can mean death or a life in debts over therei sure nurses and pca are disgusted with the management of the hospitalif you re a cop and someone is doing this and you think she s faking it call an emt to confirm it s not worth risking their life or your career over itthe video captures the officers passing around a can of lysol to spray on themselves why do people hate cops again remind mein america healthcare system kill yousome people need to lose their livelihood at some point they may develop some empathy along the way how the fuck do you look at that and not think something is uphas the hospital responded or added their take on thisthe hospital refused to treat her they called the cops she said she was having a stroke they laughed at her wrote her off and guess what she died from a stroke everyone involved should be charged the hospital the officers everybodyimagine that american cops behaving copssweet baby jesus my heart aches for this woman and any family she has at best these officers were callous to the point of abuse i hope they are punished somehow after their paid vacation fucking pigsas long as that sorry excuse for a shit stain got his coffee and oatmeal on the lords day then the cops are happy asshole cops have no humanity and deserve all the repercussions they get if you don t know what i m talking about watch the videohow is every single police officer in this country such an utter piece of shit humanbrandon wardlaw adam barnett timothy distasio and danny dugan don t let them slip under the radarthis is the lords day so this is what christian nationalism looks likeso the administration of the hospital is at fault for evicting someone that needed treatment and the officers are at fault for how they treated her on the way to the detention center all around f ed upthese cops are worth the salary they collect even if they had the worst training in the world this shit is just common sense it not like the lady just assaulted somebody she asking for medical help and acting distressed the hospital probably should be sued too for denying her care that she obviously neededi read about this case some some context as i understand it she was admitted had a work up and deemed stable for discharge she may have indeed been stable at that time she certainly seemed alert and in no distress at the very beginning of the police encounter they were called because after being discharged she refused to leave the property the police arrived and tried to make her leave she gets more upset and begins complaining of difficulty breathing at first they tell her she lying and then eventually find her inhaler they keep trying to chuck her into a police van but she heavy and ends up on the ground her condition worsens and they pull her into the back of a police car on her back she repeatedly tells the officers she ca breathe in this position they ignore her and drive around for 20 minutes until she dies coroner says she died of a stroke and absolves the police saying she did suffer trauma or restraint asphyxia personally i think she suffered from positional asphyxia complicated by an underlying lung problem i put the biggest part of this on the police if she was complaining of difficulty breathing while on the sidewalk they could have taken her to the er or called the ambulance or had hospital personnel come to get her and take her to the er then she could have been evaluated and medically cleared of this new complainta previous post claimed the hospital booted her for not having insurance but she looks old enough to have medicare maybe it s a state of tennessee thingi watch the full video it insane how the cops were taunting and making light of the situation considering a seriously obeise person will obviously be suffering from very little effort to move and struggle to breathe on top of already having a stroke very recentlythe first mistake was the hospital releasing her they could have called a cab company or relative the behaviors from the police officers is 1 not being qualified in ems procedures 2 being callous and cruel to someone with physical mental issues it s really apparent to me how unqualified many law enforcement are the lack of training in dealing with the public is appallingred state realities california has a law preventing hospitals from doing just thisthis looks worse for the hospital than the police imo i know the narrative lately has been to show police brutality in all its colors but this just highlights how bad the medical system has gotten as well i not letting the police off the hook but it certainly was their job to diagnose a patient who they were told was fine to discharge the hospital should be sued for negligencei wondered if this was the lady they kicked out of the hospital i read about there are a few things in life that have broken me and this is one of them i don t know if i can watch this footage i know i have to though for her i just can t right nowpoor people inconveniencing hospitals with illnesses send em off to the cops to diethe hospital was legally obligated to provide her with medical care https https if they refused to treat her they were in violation of federal law there is no middle ground here it is a legal obligation to treat anyone who comes to their emergency room if she was claiming a shattered ankle a simple would have proven that one way or the other i can not imagine any hospital discharging anyone with a shattered ankle even a cheap ass one it too easy to get wrecked by federal law and sued a possible stroke yeah i could see a cheap ass hospital declining to do advance imaging to determine what was happening and then claiming her symptoms did hit the level for advanced imaging either way if they treated her and released her when she was this sick then there is a major malpractice suit coming their way possibly criminal depending on the actual circumstances the police i kind of mixed on this i would assume that they are working with the information that the doctors provided and would have no reason to question that if the police thought there was truly a problem they should have taken her to another hospital if one wasno one has any empathy anymore and it s killing all of uscops are such heroes saving this hospital from this dying woman what would we do without themthe police officer stated that this is gods i m sure he ll get a raisethis breaks my heart what are we if we can not help the weakest in our society what is wrong with usthey understood that charges were not filed because the police did have an involvement in her death bullshit if you run from the cops and one of those cops has a heart attack you will be charged for deathcops humiliate people every damn day and they get to hide behind paid leave they don t face any consequences they get to berate and antagonize us but we don t get the same satisfaction when they fuck up they didn t care even a little about this woman s comforti recently displayed a textbook reaction to a low glucose level when asked if i was ok someone else my store manager answered for me that i was fine assholes need to keep their mouths shut when it comes to another person s wellbeingabsolutely the police mishandled this but i hope legal action is taken that the hospital takes responsibility for its part in this tooremovedamericans often terrorized by their own health financial news media and law enforcement systems it almost like we neither a democracy or a republic but something else entirelymy mom died of a stroke at 59 if this had been her you d catch me behind bars for the rest of my lifedisgusting assholes with zero humanity left i gon na cry for that poor woman no one deserves to die like that with some morons laughing at you and spraying themselves with lysol like you some kind of vermin they want to disinfectfour cops who cant check a pulse and cant tell if someone is alive or dead this whole police department needs fbi supervisionthe america republicans wantthose heroes deserve medals do they the doctor that refused treatment needs to be promoted to head to medicine boss call all aroundgood things those cops had extensive medical training to determine if someone is faking a medical conditionthis happened in tennessee said that state on its own would be considered a third world shitholeok ya the police officers kinda treated her like crap but what the fuck is wrong with that hospital she said she was in abdominal pain and they wrote that off as constipation that hospital should be under investigation tothe cops went through her things while she was asking for a of trouble breathing grabbed her pack of cigarettes and said want a cigarette to her she said no holy hell fire them all and retrain the entire forcepolice in this country treat every poor person like absolute scum the police are only there to protect those with capital defundsomeone should be prosecuting the hospital more then the policefor profit medicine at its bestinteresting how this is the being portrayed as the police officers fault and not the hospitalsamerica a place for americanswithout knowing more it s hard for me to place blame for her death on anyone except the officers while a person is in their custody they are responsible for them that doesn t automatically make them responsible for her death the careless and dismissive way they handled her the way they ignored her pleas and ignored her obvious difficulties breathing all speak to a lack of empathy that should not exist in any situation because she died of a stroke they may not end up legally responsible for her death but in my eyes they are not worthy of their position and deserve negligent homicide charges at the very leastlived her entire life just to go out like that this country is a fucking disgrace our police are a fucking disgrace our health system is a fucking disgracethis is fucked up on multiple levels our healthcare system the staff that deemed her stable to leave the treatment by police the clear signs of distress and of stroke and the police still calling her names as she is dyingi feel like the hospital is at faultafter she refused to leave someone was paid money to write this shit she could barely moveah yes the lovely american healthcare system when they are dying for mass shootings they die from shitty healthcarei just hope all the responsible parties will get the hammer i really really hope so because this is just so sadthe police didn t help the situation but the responsibility for her death is almost entirely on the hospitalthe people defending the hospital and the police here wtfif the officers didn t assume she was pretending this might have been i hope the officer who was more worried about fucking coffee rather than doing his job feels total shit but probably not that being said the hospital is at huge fault for this i hope they get in major trouble for this but i m doubtfulthis is on that shitty hospital not the pdso painfully sad four police officers and not one of them with a shred of decency nor empathyhealth care and police in america summed up nicelyand we should de fund the police or take away their immunity so where were the good cops in this video all of them need to be sued for their treatment of this woman x200b x200b disgusting behaviorshe was only treated this well because she had 3 extra points in life white woman imagine if this was a 25 year old black mani don t know if she s faking it or what but she s not answering he is heard saying as he lifts edwards head by the hair just fire every police department at this point let start overa reminder that any police interaction is potentially lethalthe hospital and the police killed herthe blue gang continues with their gang activitiesthis is atrocious yet unsurprising as someone with essentially zero faith in either of those systems i stand by my convictionsonce again the police are bastardsi no friends of the cops but i honestly put this on the hospital it no way this women should have been dischargedtypical i familiar with a saying if all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail it about time to retrain the copsthose asshole cops gon na have 3 months of vacation and back again nothing will change unless they are forced to take liability insurance and all money sued by the victims paid out of the insurance and their pockets fuck those copscops had a shitty attitude here but it seems like the hospital is at fault here i not sure the cops could do anything the cops are responding to a trespassing call by the hospital that had in theory evaluated here are the cops supposed to supercede a hospitals diagnosis i would want thatmurica could benefit from a healthy dose of socialism that late stage capitalism is evil afas someone from the uk who has free healthcare which is overrun and always in danger of being privatised by greedy politicians can i ask our american friends how much they pay for insurance per month to ensure they get medical care like is it a nominal amount per month which actually represents good value or is it prohibitively expensive unless you get a decent salary and is there government funding for the poor of societydeletedevery police officer who appears in this video should be charged with murder this is disgusting the police hate people and this video shows you exactly that these police officers need to go to prison for the rest of their livesi not a fan of cops but whatever happened to this woman is not on them they uncaring but they were allegedly called by the hospital that had discharged her and said she is leaving it was effectively a trespass call by a hospital the cops probably see people lying about reasoning all day long and yeah did want to deal with her crap so were just treating it as such when she still refused to leave after a medical facility discharged her they had to arrest her this is all on the hospital for misdiagnosis not on the cops for being frankly cops edit this is not an excuse of their behavior by any meansas often as we see cops abusing their power on reddit i think this is a case where thr cops acted according to procedure and did do anything wrong the hospital should be held liable they did fully consider this woman medical needs and ejected her from the hospital without a proper medical exam the cops showing up probably assumed that if a hospital is ejecting someone that person is probably medically fit to be taken to prison the doctor who examed her and the one in charge of the er should both be brought before a review boardthe thing is the only reason anyone cares

definitely have the chemicals in me but there s no one in town who can run the toxicological tests to find out which ones they are lovett 40 an auto detailer told the new york post in an extremely voice my voice sounds like mickey mouse my normal voice is low it s hard to breathe especially at night my chest hurts so much at night i feel like i m drowning i cough up phlegm a lot i lost my job because the doctor won t release me to go to worki have seen any comment on this a spokesman for norfolk southern told the post that the company consulted experts including governor mike dewine say what nowthe ns would be better off buying every house in that town and knocking em down cheaper in the long runi feel like it is criminal for the governor to tell the residents it was ok to return to their homes stage probably fake drinking demonstration before the epa did a thorough investigation of the safety of the water and air this looks like the governor prioritized politics and money over the safety of his constituentsremember how no one went to jail after the housing crises watch as no one goes to jail for poisoning a whole cityi lost my job because the doctor won t release me to go to welcome to americai love how last week i was talking about the death this is gon na cause and someone was like nobody died yeah because cancer and illness is immediate turns out that shit takes

improvements aside from their own stuff then plant a forest and make it a wildlife sanctuarywhat kind of corporate dystopia is this where you get by one companys chemicals then fired by your own for being sick within a week he probably lose his house and savings and go to jail for medical debt nowgovernor mike dewine is so useless thanks for nothing be sure to vote you out next timeyou know what s fucked up i just looked up norfolk southern s share price and it s only down 12 in the past month this company should be on the hook for billions in cleanup healthcare and compensation to local residents but clearly the market doesn t think that willnorfolk southern has proven they ca be trusted and should be allowed to run any trains they only finally cleaned up their derailment in big beaver pa after a year because of the press from the east palestine derailment back in 2005 another norfolk southern train derailed in east deer allegheny county pa outside of pittsburgh with ruptured tankers of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride landing in the allegheny river the railroad insisted there was no danger but the black smoke irritated airways and eyes even miles away my dad operated a local water treatment plant that pulled water for multiple local towns from the allegheny river near the derailment and he insisted it was way more dangerous than we were being told that train also derailed in february and my dad would let me go into the river that summer because he did trust that more chemicals had gone into the river based on the water readings he tested after the derailment but since it was 2005 there was any national news coverage to press norfolk southern for answers httpsinsanely fucked i hope everyone in the area starts raising hell on the politicians and shitohio residents if you live anywhere near this accident schedule a baseline health screening right now the norfolk southern railroad with the help of the ohio gop will absolutely try to claim that any resulting health problems from chemical exposure was preexisting which is why it is so important to gather as much evidence as possible now to demonstrate otherwisei read the material safety data sheet for vinyl chloride and aside from being nightmare fuel it makes it clear that the slow onset of symptoms is a critical part of the presentation of exposure to concentrationsthis is an absolute tradgedy a diaster for this community imagine ur working class family who owns your own home in a working class but safe town you worked hard for your home and you are rich but u have what you need then all of a sudden an event u have absolutly no control over occurs and your whole town becomes a bio hazard your house is worthless because no one wants to move there your faced overnight with the reality that if u stay you and your whole family may very well develop a deadly illness in who knows how long of a time if you go u lose everything it unthinkable and all so a bunch of already wealthy millionaire board members could get some more coins by cutting corners i can not imagine being faced with what these people are dealing with i hope they get justicehmmmmmmm i wonder what caused thathow long did dewine take to order a state of emergencyi do understand why the governor has declared a state of emergency that would allow all sorts of resources to be brought in for the residents one of those resources could be activating the national guard to bring in safe drinking water oregon did that when the salems water supply was unsafe to drink due to cytotoxins from an algae bloom in the water source the natural guard provided safe drinking water for about three monthsjust glancing at the article i realize seeing the pictures we need to do ppe education as i ve seen several articles and photos of the area and residents wearing ppe that s ineffective for the possible contaminants please note i m not saying to judge at but i m a nurse and it s something i ve noticed is that maybe in accidents like this we could ensure to educate the town or provide proper ppe while clean up is occuring however i must add sadly i see corporations seeing that as admission of guilt just makes me think as a nurse of things we can do better if we weren t so blanketed by corporates just me spinning myca get sued if everyone dies norfolk southernthere a great quote of supposedly cree origin when the last tree is fallen the last fish caught the last river poisoned only then will they realise they can not eat moneythis has been a widespread problem since the dawn of the industrial revolution my first job as a lab tech after college the consulting engineer told us about his first job decades earlier where the chemical producer had lit the river on fire with its flammable contamination what super shameful is that in the 1970s the public had consensus that we wanted these kinds of pollution cleaned up and prevented yet here we are well into the 21st century still dealing with it regularlymy voice sounds like mickey mouse my normal voice is low maybe we can get republicans to support safety rules if we call them gender changing chemicalsif you or someone you know lived near or around palestine oh in 2023 you may be oh the commercial is definitely comingthe governor said it was safe to return and has been covering ns ass this entire time he needs to be held accountable the

lawsuit already underway and train companies are very familiar with what s expected of them in terms of mitigating the damages to all those affected what happens now is lots of town hall meetings info gathering bio data like names medical conditions symptoms losses like jobs or having to stay at your aunt s house in another town it s going to be very expensivei really angry that all those people were tricked into thinking it was safe to go back welp i guess they die thenhopefully this is a wake up call to some americans what a truly fucked up situationi was driving to west virginia yesterday and i drove past e palestine for a little but and the moment i got within like a 10 mile range of the city limits there was this chemical stench that almost made me vomit i was only passing by for maybe minutes down 11 before it went awat but if that stench is over thebwhole town holy fuck man i wore a mask preemptively hoping it would help but it did hide the smellfluorocarbons in the ozone layer first the water and the wildlife go pretty soon there not a creature stirring except the robots at the dynamo1000 settlement and people are actually taking it speechlessoh thank god if they live it would cost a lot more money than if they die of capitalismwelcome to america money over everythingthis is going to get too big to ignore before too longcouple more months until the cancers arriveis a murdoch company so the feds and local government receive the heat in this article not the railroad and their toady the governor of ohiothis will keep happening until politicians and ceos are afraid for their liveseveryone should be able to move away from that area railroad can pay the costs harsh reality of america they don t really care about us heartbreaking situationthe obvious outcome is they mostly die horribly in agony whoever is left alive and disfigured for life gets a couple hundred grand not enough to hurt profit margins at all and then nothing ever really comes of itmedia please stop using weird and use a word that is actually descriptive these people are having alarming symptoms there should also be a facility available to determine blood toxicology if there is a definitive test this news article is a reprint from the new york post right wing rag no wonder it failed to mention trump deregulating rail safetythis is a pretty terribly written article i think these people are absolutely right to be concerned especially if they re experiencing any weird symptoms but i also feel like articles like this paint it as some weird government of government negligence when in reality the epa and ohio ema have been present and transparent since literally hours after the initial derailment there is an online dashboard the epa has attended local town halls the texas a m findings are notable but the article doesn t mention that at the levels that they are detecting it would take years to become a health issue and there is no reason to believe the levels will not continue to drop as they have been with soil removal and remediation all of which is ongoing with federal and state agency oversight this is a fucked up situation and norfolk southern should absolutely get fucked and we need a larger conversation about corporate and rail regulation at a federal level but articles that paint this as some chernobyl situation that no one is addressing are absolutely not helpfulman that s crazy too bad no one warned that this was gon na happen a completely unforeseen consequence no way we could have seen this coming it s not like people with relevant degrees and credentials provided any insight as to the possible outcomes of this disasterthe american people need to start holding corporations and the government accountablemurica the land of the rich fucking up and poor folks working to diealan shaw norfolk ceo hello east palestine residents i want to assure you that everything is completely fine look some of you might die but that a sacrifice we willing to make hi fives mike dewine thanks for coming to my ted talkwe don t have toxicology tests for most of the chemicals that we put into the environment let alone those that were releases and the byproducts of their burning this is why we are slowly turning out environment toxic and why america has one of the highest cancer rates in the worldah yes the wonderful nylon strangling you from the inside out has anyone seen how nylon is made now imagine those chemicals inside your body doing that thingif anyone is in that town for the sake of yourself and any children you have leaveweird symptoms it only weird if they did know what the cause wasweird symptoms and slowly dying tend to happen when you are exposed to toxic chemicals used as weapon in world war inote to self do not reproduce with anyone from a 500 mile radius of the train crashnumber of people in jail 0that governor pretending to drink the water in that woman home was very convincing like he made a second effort but he did drink any water which of course he lie and said he drank the water our fucking livesi pledge allegiance to the flag for who it poisons all nations divisible without liberty or justice for the poorthis reminds me a bit of chernobyl residents slowly dying after massive explosionnone of the big orgs are going to be held responsible they going to be using their money and special tricks to drag out any court hearings hopefully until most of the victims have died wait longer most people die less payouts that their strat to profit that what they docapitalism off its tracksyep that whole town is going to be riddled with cancer patientsthis is just the start this is like a smaller scale chernobyl no one should be allowed to live there but the american government is a business and we the people are expendable as long as they are making moneyit factually accurate that deswine did request federal assistance for some time but just pointing that out is enough the reason why the far right is able to take the initiative on this issue is because they far more interested in telling a convincing narrative one that speaks to the very real and accurate feelings of abandonment that people in east palestine and throughout the rust belt have suffered for generations it not enough to have facts there needs to be a story and a vision and there just is one coming from the democrats on this issue biden going to ukraine was imo stupid even without deswine request biden could have gone to east palestine he could be using his platform to attack the corporate power that traumatized this community and countless others he could be demanding that congress pass stricter safety laws and substantial environmental recovery assistance he could refuse to intervene in the railroad worker strike actions that could reduce future accidents he has done any of those things and trump et al are taking advantage of itthey re fucked the company will do the absolute minimum they are compelled to by government and the government will stick bandaids on bullet holes until it s no longer politically relevant to help take it from a michigander who grew up seeing flint in the news no one is going to make this right the cost of fixing it is greater than paying fines and taking some bad pr so it s not getting fixedi do see anyone mentioning that that video embedded in the article says norfolk southern is trucking the contaminated cleanup water to a facility 1300 miles away in texas and they not going to treat it no no no they disposing it by injecting it deep into the ground into the ground where groundwater comes from how is this a responsible idea i get that they are injecting it 4000ft down but its not like the earth is a closed containment system that material will migrate somewhere somepoint will it be naturally broken down is it 100 contained for the next 150 years or is it just the cheapest option we all know the answergovernment and corporate in full effectwild life dying left and right and they pretend humans are not part of the biosphere smhduh wherever there is a factory processing toxic chemicals there are health issues that crop up like cancers and lung diseases if you follow the keystone xl pipeline you see all kinds of ailments and dead fish i wonder what the demographics of this town are these greedy corporations usually choose to emit their toxins in poor communities of colorif the world was just the entire company would be forced into bankruptcy to make this right and he made an example of but noooopethis country is fuckednanthe social media platform now has a work force of less than down from when elon musk took it over in october wow huge cutsthey had that many leftthe monetization infrastructure team which maintains the services through which twitter makes money was reduced to fewer than eight people from 30 a person familiar with the matter said i wonder how this will effect musk plan to monetize twitter among those affected by the layoffs were several founders of small tech companies that twitter had acquired over the years and i wonder how many of these will maybe get together to found new start upsincluding esther the woman who bragged about sleeping at work to work hard for musk the leopards are feasting well todayare any companies outside hedge funds and private equity worth 48bn with less than 2k employeesat this rate the only thing that going to be left next year will be elon sitting in a dark corner trying to figure out what a div isi do know what folks expect elon is running a clown showsell the building and wfhall praise our billionaire job creators do mind the layoffsi have a theory that there are at least a handful of really good engineers that stayed on just for the book deals we heard some wild stuff come out and i bet its the tip of the icebergwe reached out for comment at the time of publication but their phones are no longer oni guess this means he does not need to pay rent on a few more office buildingsim more surprised 2000 were lefti read today that musk was supportive of dilbert creator nuff said people he gone overboard time to twitterstonkall they need is daniel radcliffe in a hoodie to keep things running apparentlyhe has to be trying to kill it on purposei increasingly believing that musk endgame with twitter is to just sell off twitter data including account contact info and all tweets to a foreign power intelligence servicesoh no did everyone have a nice supperlay them all off lock the doors pull the plug let the past diehe ca make payrollwhat exactly is he trying to do he s taking a hit with devaluing the company in this matter even he must be able to see that this isn t something he can micromanage himself out ofthis chatgpt thing i hear about will run twitter eloni might be in the minority here but i not a big twitter user i will click on an interesting tid bit here and there but that it it starting to look like i will never be a twitter person and i cool with thatremember tumblr sold back in 2010 for 1 billion resold in 2019 for 3 million the brand is ruined and will never be what it was no one squawked at all about that huge loss along comes twitter and it is headed for the same fate none of the investors are squawking at all and there a lot more money in this one musk has made lots of dumb moves but nothing sticks and the environment falls apart i think that by design twitter is one of the few places only of any size where you can speak freely and people know who is saying it you can also do it in real time and you not filtered by the media do be shocked when twitter withers away and when it too far gone musk will sell off the scraps let not forget he suddenly gone far right wing that ca be a coincidencewhy is there still twitterhe destroyed it for the saudis it pretty obviousdo they even have 200 employees left to firethat elon musk is a visionary yep turning ol twitter aroundi surprised there 200 ppl left to sacki can t believe they still have 200 employeesit must suck for those who voluntarily went for elon and spent the past four months on the grind stone just to be let go now over performance issues it sounds like a great work culture they have over thereevery time i see posts about twitter im grateful i never used it once100 wo be the ones on a visa you know whywho here thought they had less than 200they have 200 employeeshow many were oppressed whitestwitter has 200 employees left to lay offtwitter is turning into some kind of broken corner phone booth that hasn t been carted away yet he bought it to break it for politics thought he could afford to maybe notit feels great having elong blocked on twitterwho in the world still works there at this pointis the service the same i will not have anything to do with twitterdoes elon think that we wins highlander if he s the only employee leftarrr a skeleton crewis that in conjunction with tesla leaving texas and going back to californiaseems like elon takeover is going welli surprised there are still 200 people to fire i never really used twitter but it was fun while it lasted i assumebut their tech is doing soooooo well i sure it be even better with less peopleconstantly down for mei amazed twitter is running at all with so few employees working at the companymuskrats speedrun finally coming to the end i hope so tired of reading about tjis shitshowdidn t elon say he was going to grow the company i barely use twitter at all anymore i m not either i just don t really like it anymore the engagement is totally differentso that like half of the employees that are left rightit hard to feel sorry for tech workers getting laid off i lived in a couple tech sector hubs and they definitely that odd type of moderately to just plain wealthy and very out of touch i not reveling in their troubles at all i don like seeing anyone hitting hard times and i have friends from this

fucking bloated was that placeremovedremovedevery tech company is doing cutbacks they have been an inevitability for well over a year twitter is no different to any of these they just attract the elon hatethat s more than a few dozenif they gave their 7500 employees each from their 44b payout they would have billions leftoverthe real news is that they still had 200 jobs to cuteventually it will just be hard core elon andat this point i think elon is praying ai can take over everyone role so he does lose his ass on his cough investmentyou know you just got ta office space no f s5700 jobs lost because of a rich who actually a petulant little bitch ass narcissisti think people got to train for two opposite style jobs not one not the constantly learning pain in the ass strategy but two because i remember when blue collar people could find work at all and tech people found work instantly now everyone needs a plumber and companies are firing techies left and right the economy a bitch but if you got two opposite skills you can flipi appreciate that elon musk is cutting jobs that aren t productive and aren t contributing anything there are too many jobs in our society that don t really do anything and have ambiguous job titlesabout 30mil a year in savings keep it going it his to run anyway he likes whether one likes it or notwhy everyone here says elon is dumb for that yall really thinks he does harm his company on purpose by firing people for no reason why does a socialmedia app which made no changes in the last 10 years 7000 employees no wonder this comapny was never profitablenani don t suppose calling it crying italian solves itthat commercial got me to stop throwing trash on the ground or out of car windows back in the 70si didn t realize that it was still a thing besides youtube where anyone even see it any morei m one of those for who the add worked i was a child but i would litter gum wrappers or soda cans the normal littering a kid without a grownup around might this add came on one night of tv watching and things clicked in my head i joined a volunteer park cleaning crew that spring did that up until hs ended 30 years later learning the native was in fact an ethnically italian man acting didn t change the meaning of the message it just highlighted how shitty we treat native people we don t even hire them for an add staring one of themcant wait to see the actor to replace codyas a kid i remember there was a noticeable reduction of litter along the sides of the roads when this campaign airedshould use the bear cub from prophecy movie about mercury poisoning that image was burned into my memorytime for the angry indian trying to keep shit off of his beautiful lawn that everyone keeps throwing garbage ati remember watching it as a kid and found it moving because of the ad i never threw out of a car i also remember a chris rock standup bit about this ad i think the punchline was like he did care about a uckin styrofoam cup he crying because you guys took his land and ucked his wife he does care about a cupwonder how much john oliver contributed to thisthat sent a powerful message shamedidn t they retire that in the late 70s i ve only ever seen it when someone talks about it on a showin addition to the italian thing this commercial was a ploy literally funded by big oil to put the responsibility for plastic waste on the end user fully aware of and recorded as acknowledging that recycling was an effective method of dealing with plastic pollution as long as the customer thinks recycling is working that what matterschief jay strongbow was an idol in our house and he also turned out to be italian the guy who played wild eagle on was italiani more surprised that they were still using it 45 years lateri wish they would that commercial hit people hard when it aired if anything they should be showing it more to this generationi met iron eyes he came to my junior high it was my first celeb encounter i m sharing not right now in a talky inter webs place under his whenstill being usedthe one that has not aired in decades great effort will make a huge difference in nothingi understood the campaign i think and definitely liked it it was an early call and needed but honestly it s not just about native americans we all live off this planeti heard that dude wasn t even a native american that he was of italian decent anyone else hear thatthat s a spitting image of carmine soprano if i ve ever seen one i feel passive aggressively harassed just by looking at this photo my bp is upi do understand how it supposed to be bad and racist thing to show native americans caring for the land because somebody might crack a joke people can joke about anything so i do really see the logic i feel like people are taking the wrong message away from college today that you just need to make a big stink about some random thing being racist and therefore it is and therefore you great for making a press release about it what happened to contextual thinkinglooks like tony sopranos muthadid you think it was a trifle unnecessary to see the crack in his bottomdude is italian iirci feel like it become pointless now that the world is ending due to an excess of pollution on a global scalei produced a breakcore cover of this commercial instrumental with rage against the machine vocals to capture the rage of native americans and how they must feel today about a year ago listen to crying indian super king by on soundcloud httpsremovedyup looks like it did work maybe running a crying white soccer mom campaign would have worked betterthat guy was mexican not native americannow everybody is cryinghoping for empathic response from people that genocided you is kinda unrealistic maybe they should do one with the laughing indianthere was a lot less litter back then but not due to the crying indian single use stuff was rarely was made of plastic and a lot of states charged a deposit on bottles and cansnannice that most headlines do run with who operated the train and instead continue to refer to it as ohio train derailment it was ohio train it was norfolk southern train shipments of contaminated waste to resume from norfolk southern train derailment sitethe fucked up part about all of this is that there will likely be no tangible and material policy change as a result of this accident the government wo fix this going forward and this shit will continue to happenepa seems to have changed where they are sending the waste the water was being shipped all the way down to houston now it seems to being sent to somewhere in ohio100 this shit happens again within 100 miles of this city inside the next yearsome of the liquid wastes will be sent to a facility in vickery ohio where it will be disposed of in an underground injection well shore said norfolk southern will also beghin shipping solid waste to the heritage incinerator in east liverpool lovelyoh good glad it is back to normal now proceed with the aluminum nitrate shipments on this surprisingly sketchy rail linecapitalism dictates this must continue if two more trains full of toxic materials derail in east palestine within the next year and it just as bad guess what happens more trains carrying toxic materials will ride the same line within a few weeks after those the profits must continue people be damned they will put out minimal aid with the only goal of that aid being staving off an increase in collective class consciousness the population of east palestine is small but there are more than enough to stop any trains moving through the town if they wanted that is what they do want them or us to realizewell good to know that we ve officially learned nothing from all this see you in a few days when this all happens againall aboard the pollution train choo chooi think it seems like total bs that the epa seems to be saying everything is fine who is running the epa nowi m surprised the residents haven t ripped the track up to stop them fuck all that noisewe re going to start seeing derailments on the news with the same regularity mass shootingsif the people in this state elect republicans this is what will happen human suffering and death are collateral damage to profitaren t we pumping nasty stuff into the ground for cash already all over ohioquick hide the evidenceif i were a repulicrap i would argue that it is disgusting that they are cleaning up the toxic waste to texas and that it was disgusting that they were not cleaning up the toxic waste at the same timei m surprised gary indiana didn t volunteer to take itdying to know who was originally on the shipping end and receiving end of this personally i don t blame the train line so much as the people manufacturing and purchasing these products what is this stuffspiderman solved this days ago httpsdumb question but where is this hazardous waste from is there a better way to dispose of it and do we actually need to make whatever results in this type of dangerous waste or is it just something we think we needamerica is on the movenanafter all the craps russia did there are still people who are still i can never figure that outthat s a bold move cotton let s see how it plays outnot sure why there would be russian sympathizers in lithuania still it took 50 years to gain back their

ukrainenanthe flight was in the air for about 14 minutes and had reached an altitude of just over when radar noticed the plane was in a descending right turn at a high rate of descent landsberg said obviously no idea what happened but sounds like they went into a dive that exceeded the airframes survivable speedinterestingly enough mentour pilot just had a video about an incident where the pilots

afluenzaed out of his charges well connected teen finally charged after mowing down cyclists httpsbased on what i reading this does seem like a targeted attack more like careless driving that why he being charged with manslaughteri m a pool guy i drive on this road almost everyday this is a road i have always said something like this is going to happen the drivers that are on this road go at least 15 over at a minimum speed limit is 45 and everyone does at least 60 the bridge is also located at the bottom of a twisty desert road the saddest thing about this is that about 70 of the people driving and speeding on this road are law enforcement officers the homes they live in are at the top of the hillremovedshit like this really drives home the fact that we need to take some serious looks at our drivers license laws and requirements specifically in az where this took place the standard license doesnt expire for what feels like forever my drivers license as an example is good through 2060 i have friends who have licenses that dont expire until 2065 while cars are generally getting safer many are also getting substantially heavier especially as electric vehicles push into the market it is batshit crazy to me that you dont need a commercial license or a special license of some sort to drive something like the new electric hummer which has a curb weight of lbs a ford f150 weighs about lbs by comparison you can make any standard car as safe as you want but if you get hit by someone texting in a 10k lb vehicle going 50 mph you are probably fucked living in phoenix the amount of careless driving i see every day is terrifying people text and drive run reds brake check etc and pay no mind to the fact that they are literally operating heavy machinery glad there are charges being pressed but damn it would be nice if there was a serious push to make people safer not just vehicles in cars to detect when a driver is texting more stringent license requirements and more specific categories based on vehicle weight not just application are some examples of things that could seriously reduce the amount of incidents that happen as a result of carelessnessit s always

talking to the press about this story thinks they are 100 correct about their assessment because there may very well be good people on the russian side who after mariupol fell under russian control helped the family and showed them kindness not everyone in putin murder machine is a soviet union wannabe and so when shown kindness people who have suffered may truly believe they are now on the right side or possibly and simply the parents did what they felt they needed to do in order to keep their kids alivestraight from the handmaid talenani love that it s someone s job to organize all the drugs on the table in a pretty little display like it s a bake salei d like to congratulate drugs for winning the war on drugsa joint drug bust and zero joints seized i bet they feel foolishand after they lock it up with the other piles of dope confiscated over the years and finish congratulating themselves the cartels will still shrug it off cause they barely noticed the hityou kill 100 people there s still probably cartel operatives here in mexico so you re not going to change that and most of them are hidden in cities towns and houses and moving around you re not going to take out the cartel that way so it s a very big challenge said grillo this bust is a drop in the bucket for major cartels as long as there is a demand there will be a supply cartels are supplying the drugs and us citizens are bringing them across the border the drug war is a failed policy and only furthers the power of cartels and their criminal activities meanwhile addiction is destroying north america from the inside out without any meaningful social reform the demand will continue to rise rats prefer social interaction to heroin or methamphetamine https edited to add studydid we win the drug war yetno one mentioning the fucking bazooka on the tableabout 10 years ago we were driving through a rural portion of arizona stopped at a gas station where there were a bunch of cops crowded around one of the bays just chatting behind them was multiple bricks of coke and weed stacked on the top of a car trunk one of the cops told us it was a minor bust there must have been at least 50 bricks therewait meth is actually blue is that cuz of breaking bad hypeno joke there was some clip of a drug bust from sweden and it turned out to be gram of weed and the cop says afterward you never know we might just have saved a life todayand not a single cop died from exposure overdosewelp someone is getting killed for fucking up that baddope on the table danielswo make any difference at all of coursei ve seen the wire i know what this meansnow is the time to open addiction clinics in arizona then people at the bottom of the rung users and addicts in the area are going to need support now that the supply is dried up strangle the supply by helping stop use and addiction and the demand will fall not saying this is a perfect solution or will work but enough people can get life changing and saving help to make it worth itremovedjoint drug bust hmm i don t see weed in the list of what wasi love the totes in the front that are tilted forward spilling forth like a cornucopia cops have such a flair for drama with this stuff when it s not railroading somebody or ruining lives it s kind of adorablenot even one truckload cartel be like lol kthe us government will really do anything except provide mental health care for addicts it not as profitable as seizing drugs and cash tho unfortunatelydang all of that cause they were looking for a joint lucky copshow do they dispose of all those drugs incinerate it alloh oh some small time player s got tooken out by a larger one i know this because i guarantee you that the drug trade in arizona has not been impacted by this and that if we really wanted to end the drug problem it could be done in less than a month probably if those at the highest levels of government and law enforcement weren t in on it themselves but that s the real problem that no one focuses onyou got ta give these dealers some is a shit load of drugs they certainly are an industrious bunch not sure why they get such a bad rep imagine what they could do if we only made planting trees a major felony or if collecting sea garbage was punishable by life in prisongood job on the 2000lbs boys getting those million pills off the street is a great thingprobably moving 5x that right after the bustis pounds a methric toni will guarantee that anyone who wants fetty or meth can still get it today this is a dog and pony show designed to get you to continue giving your money to the drug war instead of demanding the necessities of human existence for ityet people still going to jail for makes sensethe cia will just confiscate it from the police and sell it back to the cartelso they raised the price per hit by a buck for a week for one major distribution pointthat extra impressive if they were only looking for jointsthat is one large jointdrugs are really expensivesell it back to the drug dealers and seize it again infinite money glitchshit that a lot of fent a lot of cops must have died looking at thatthey just saved the lives of a whole lot of wt peopleproof that the dea and fbi are doing their jobs but the right wing news will state we need to close the borderlook at all the drugs biden is letting into the country tomorrow s republican talking pointno wonder i can t get my adderall prescription fillednow the us government can redistribute it on their ownthe cartels ohand the beat goes on the war on drugshttpsprice of the brick is going upwow thats enough to keep me high for daysjesse we need to cookif it was a joint bust then where s the weedif it was a joint drug bust then they would ve seized pot i ll see myself outdo they employ a stylist to set up these silly displaysrepublicans this means the dea is not workingthat s an awfully familiar shade of bluehow they test the validity of the drugs httpsby my police math that s enough to kill everyone on the planet great job i wonder how many cops overdosed looking at this picturemaybe calling it joint drug bust could use some thoughtman we should build a inside the tunnelsthere are drugs and then there are things that just kill you police should focus 100 on the latteran actual drug bust not just some weedthis is an insane amount of drugs and people arrested 3 years paid off on this onewe should attach the haul to balloons and float them over chinanow that s a respectable drug bustis this a lot because i feel like it a lot but i usually wrong when i feel this waydamn they found the stashi m watching breaking badthis is news this is copogandawhen cartels can lose 1b of drugs in the ocean and don t care you know the drug war is lost and over like gwot republicans taking l s all over all the timeso that s what the az gop is hooked on and why they believe elections are fake and keep suing trying to win now weed understandi assume the cartels negotiated for something big to allow this to be seized you can take the but do touch the shipping containerpills and 300 pounds safely locked up sirlet just say we make this stuff mostly legal it ca be any worseyou know sometimes there are drug busts and i m kind of like it s a little bit unfortunate all of those drugs are going to go to but for a bust like this i m honestly cheeringgreat job this is chemical warfare being waged against americans by china and the cartelsif these drugs were legal measuring the amounts and getting people help for their delusional thoughts would be a lot easier and planned i do know i just one person i have seen people function as the nicest human beings on meth what i have learned at this point is good people are good people and negative people are negative people they have to want to change from negative to goodlegalize all drugs and fund treatment you kill the cartels by taking away their income that is the only solutionnever fully understood drug busts more product will just come in it make things more expensive for people to buy on the streets for awhile maybe that it need to address the root of the problem which is not rooting up drug cartels but rather by reducing demand by adding more support for drug rehabilitation programs to help existing users and reducing poverty to prevent new usersfrom the drug makers to the police it all about 50 more dealers hit the streetsgood get that curse off the streetsthe cost of seizure is baked into the pricing was it only drugs and no cash there had to be cashcops out here finding this shit meanwhile it a pain in the ass for an average person unless you cold copof course this was a short term rental too the owner of the house should be charged too these short term rentals really wreak havoc on neighborhoodsdoes the fact that this amount of illegal drugs exist make the war on drugs a complete failure it has never actually been a war on drugs but rather a war on people who use drugs how about we stop waging war on peoplemaga hate seizures they liked it when we stopped less of ityeah but did they find the jointi wonder how many cops oded from being in the same roomthe dark side of capitalism is the robust black market that lurks in the shadows it s the epitome of capitalism an unregulated free market that s driven purely by demandit seems to me drugs are being transported by vehicle across the border not by poor people hustled across the desert by smugglerslooking at this and all the addicts on like kensington ave youtube vids can we go all singapore yet and start up the death penalty for dealing pthis shit about to cost as much as eggsblank party confiscates drugs for their own celebration partyitt people slamming the war on drugssad how intent america is on destroying itselfquestion for you younger people do you know people taking these pills is this a common party drug now how are people not scared to take a drug that kills so manynancurrently live in kansas the number of wind farms is insane such that they are almost part of the natural character of the countryside not only that but the farms are often on top of huge oil and natural gas deposits so some landowners will have their farmland usda crop subsidies gas oil wells and windmills all making them money from the same spot if you are smart you can make more than decent money with a quarter section of land in those areas although acreage prices are pretty nuts right nowregardless of political parties i am glad to hear anything that will enhance renewable engergy productionsgreat their success is everyone success and the more people come to depend on it the less unnecessarily controversial it will begood now it a contest do let other states beat you who can do the most the fastestclean energy will inevitably take over it generating energy out of thin air literally no need to mine man even if they still in this day and age believe climate change is a hoax why not do it for economic reasons drop the act already it okay to agree with liberals here no need to distroy our country and world out of spite seriously though i work in the civil engineering design side and the coal ash waste piles are toxic for years so now they top them off with solar panels nothing else they can do with that land it just makes sense to win outbecause if you look at the footprints where solar and wind energy is actually feasible they are almost all in the sunbelt and the great plains statesi mean yeah they are generally huge and empty perfect for wind and solar rather hard to do a ton in places like njthey mention our excellent wind turbine programs here in oklahoma but i wish they d cover how we d be doing even better in solar if local oil and gas companies didn t bribe local lawmakers to put giant financial hurdles in front of home owners who want to install solar panels on their homesthis is kind of silly when you think about it most red states are larger with more access to wide open spaces and shore lines all of those things are great for solar and wind generation blue states are usually small and clustered in the north east with relatively little shoreline and not a lot of wide open spaces notice how california is mentioned as having the most well thats partly due to the fact that it hugewhy do people in america have such small minds grow up not all republicans hate renewable energy and not all democrats hate gas what people here are doing only worsens the divide our country has because it is the attitude of a 3rd grader who wants to make fun of someone they don t like we all benefit from this technology it s not about us vs themred states are generally the most feasible aka economical for renewables more sun more wind more available landoil company s are converting some their refineries into renewable diesel refineries because they will get their products subsidized via tax credits when the government gives out free money it s just good business to take itgood credit where credit is duenice they have the right geography and companies like money go green gosince it never clarified it in the article is the electricity generated consistent it said renewable energy generated enough power for 64 million homes but for how longthat great news why is there such a weird divide over free energygive it time arkansas here currently a bill in our deep red state congress to do away with solar payback hb1370 would eliminate the 100 full retail payback of solar generated energy fed back into the electric grid they also want to limit the size of commercial arrays so places like they do have any more businesses getting wild ideas like batesville school districtlow population density more than any other factor predicts conservative beliefs as well as suitability for alternative energy production infrastructureyeah there huge wind farms here in wyoming good place for them too also we building the chokecherry and sierra madre wind energy project it scheduled to be completed in 2026 and when it comes online will be the largest wind farm in the country and one of the largest in the world i really think wyoming should be investing more in wind and solar though our weather is the most friendly to solar but we a big empty state might as well put all that space to usewe need to stop this us vs them mentality when it comes to politics in the statesa friend of mine trades for a small texas electric coop and said as long as he called it energy production there was never any pushback but if he slipped and said renewables they would drop it altogetherred states get the most sun and the most windits not about red vs blue its about united states if we do good with solar and wind it does not matter where it isthe united states will literally be paying the price for delaying actual construction of offshore wind instead of just talking about it for decades and that on the blue states https us renewable energy developer avangrid escalated its high stakes dispute with the state of massachusetts by filing a notice of appeal to pull out of offtake contracts for its gigascale commonwealth wind on the grounds the project has become unfinanceable because of the aggregate impact of unprecedented global economic headwinds including historic inflation sharp increases in interest rates and supply chain bottlenecks the current ppas do not allow the company to secure the significant financing needed to construct this critical project said avangrid spokesperson craig gilvarg offshore wind projects take between eight and ten years to move through the state and federal process resulting in long gaps between when ppas are issued and permits approved the longer that gap the more likely that some unanticipated event is going to happen that could impact the economics of a project said kaplowitz if we can get the permitting process to be to be more efficient and predictable we can reduce those uncertaintiesyou never know by the way republicans hate on renewable energyi have to say for all the shit it gets when i drove through tx there is a lot of wind and solar one of those things where the red politicians are probably shittalking it while in the backroom they are heavily invested before it truly takes off then they will change their tune they know its the future you can see it when you there they just say that stuff on television for the voters also tx had the best kept interstate smooth as hell i live in the bay area in california which has some of the wealthiest zip codes on the planet and tolls everywhere you drive and there are frequent stretches of 80 east in certain lanes that make my teeth rattle what are they spending the money on i enjoy a lot of things about california but when it comes to spending money efficiently and correctly we could use serious improvementit almost like everyone wants to be off grid wish we would stop taking all that oil moneyred states are usually sunnier or flat and likely windier no surprise tbh it will only help them in the future too so good for themnevada is technically blue but we are 80 federal open land then we have privately owned land that has like 4 owners thats a bit of an exaggeration in case it wasnt obvious we are a hotspot for solar duh and geothermal we have tons of renewable companies creating solar farms and generating power and tying into our power grid all good things in my opinion we have the space so why notlove to see more and get us off of fossil fuels put one in my towni was surprised by this while traveling cross country lots of windmills in the plains and mountain stateslarge rural areas equal conservative voters and space for solar panels and wind farmsi m down for it the policies advance in a different political environment if climate change fails as a moral argument at least some people will get behind it on economic groundsdamn that pretty awesomemostly because red states have shitty grid power and their utility are reliablewho would have thunk that it s easier to build infrastructure in places that don t believe in excessive regulation of businessah the old correlation causationmakes sense if red states do do much to help regulate power companies and they keep raising their prices people will look for other alternatives to get lower utility prices we ended up getting a solar array installed on our property our summer electricity bill is less than 20 a monththat pretty cool good for them hopefully the blue states will catch up soontexas has a lot of windfarms but the governor blames them for power grid problems as he has no idea how power workswell blue states a little less talking and a bit more doingeveryone is pointing at availability of land which is fair cheaper labor relaxed regulations and site specific suitability are also factors shit on red states all you want half my neighbors are as dumb as you think at the same time you could triple my pay to return to a solid blue metropolitan area and i still have perfectly reasonable hesitations based on how i measure qolnot surprising they have the most empty spaceyeah it a business that they can capitalize off of if it was a subsidized system this would be an issueannoyed grumbles is what i m reading give me a break people be happy for once that s a indicative of progressyes those states have the highest average wind speeds and the most unobstructed sunlighttbf red states are the wide open lands that are likely best suited to that a lot more than blue states which are frequently more mountains and citiesthey were against it until it started becoming cheap and profitable and in another 10 year red states will claim that renewables were all their idea to begin withbiggest issue is zoning and high costs of property even obvious lay up projects get blocked like hydro quebec in northern maine thanks to maine residents being idiots and accepting higher power costs just to spite their utility which screwed over all of new englandred states are usually more rural which means more land to develop these things on i dont think it has anything to actually do with red or bluegeographically this makes sense i do see the irony in itit could be that these states often have the wide open land that supports these systems it not a thing when major capital gets involvedi mean iowa was solidly purple when the push for wind was made in the state and it was started with big government actionswell yeah most of them are empty lots of room for wind farms and solar parksyes that s because that s where all the space isworth mentioning that iowa started down this path when we were still reasonably progressive it been a long painful descent into madness since we were the first to legalize gay marriage and helped elect obamainteresting dynamic if blue states became dependent on red states for powershhh don t tell the red states thatif true good on themthe world would be so much better if could be convinced to own the libs by getting cleaner cheaper more sustainable electricityred states have huge tracts of empty land compared to blue states that what makes them red so yeah this checks outthe reason they are doing it is federal money they don t give a rat s ass if it s a good thing that said i m glad it s working out thus farthis makes sense if you think about it there money to be made there a shitload of federal money that red states love despite their stated principles and probably the biggest factor is that both wind and large scale solar require a lot of empty space a resource that red states have in abundancedoesn t surprise me many red states have a lot of land also politically it makes good sense to get the detractors on board through creating green jobs in their back yardthey also dominate in barren plainsi thought red states believed wind and solar were fakequick let pretend like they are really owning the libs by installing more renewable energy than those silly blue states who just ca keep upi wonder w hat cou ld be themust be all the hot airin other news red states have lots of farmsoh no you are owning us liberals so hard by beating us in green energy please stopsounds pretty woke out thur in them red statesres states are vast open wastelands at this point what else would they be useful for to humansso misleading red states with blue centres and gerrymandered voting maps they should be blue states pushing a blue agenda against every ounce of red resistance republicans in red states would rather burn at the stake than embrace renewablesbetween stuff like this and elon musk going full right wing yeah it kinda baffling why conservatives still demonize using anything other than coal as fuelmust be all the hot air they producewell no duh the federal subsidies are massive and no red state refuses thisegreat now they ll be less of a drag on functional statesheadline should say redneck statesalmost like red states are more rural areas where windmills are more effective these areas are typically less educated so being red makes sense bring on those downvotes down votes but majority of the kids who graduated high school and stayed in their home towns are conservativesthat s likely skewed by texas and the fact that most red states are hotwell if blue states likely have a good then of course red states would lead now because they have to work double to catch upi m here just for the salt and it is everything i could have imaginedhilarious that they re the ones screaming about how stupid alternative energy is what s the deal with thatgood much of those economies relied upon coal and oil and with those industries phasing out it is incredibly efficient to retrain them in the new tech that is replacing their areas of expertisewhat is a red state for non americansthey do have the most empty landok hold on but the new report shows iowa and oklahoma all of which have republican governors and majority republican state legislatures led the nation in wind power production all in the mid west with some of the fiercest winds and lots of open fields its very hard to profit from farming and wind turbines let most of the land still be used for farming keeping farms solevant so not all republican states just the ones in locations its impossible to ignore doing to it being almost perfectly suited for large scale wind farmingsolar and wind require huge tracks of land that are not developed industrially where do you find that the red states also you have to go where the wind blows for turbines and that is the upper midwest and the west to idaho montana wyoming and oregon it is a functional decision you ca have a massive wind or solar farm anywhere near new york or california unless it is in the desert and then you have a supply chain issuefor anyone curious as to why it s not the states investing it s the corporations and fortunately for red states all of the best most consistent windy conditions occur in middle america solar is fantastic in the south blue states are at a disadvantage for both of those technologies but improved efficiency and better storage methods will soon expand viable locations for new sites as it stands most of the prime wind real estate is already taken so companies are starting to get more involved with offshoreiowan here i just wish they could figure out a way to get rid of the synchronized red blinking lights in these wind turbinesi knew belgium was building a large wind farm in the north sea and out of interest checked how big one of those massive wind farms in texas are turned out that whatever belgium is building is tiny compared to what texans have already and that just one of their windfarmsso the sunnier and windier parts of the country basicallyironically batteries to store renewables are less renewable than fossil fuels fossil fuels are actually renewable on a time scale of thousands of years since they stored solar energy through photosynthesis and the food chain from plants to animals we just need to reduce the use rate of fossil fuels to match the replenishment rate we can fill in the gaps with renewable energy and nuclear energy where it makes sense using solar panels on areas without enough sun shine to compensate for the carbon cost of manufacturing the panels is actually counterproductivein two papers published today in the journals environmental research letters and joule harvard university researchers find that the transition to wind or solar power in the would require five to 20 times more land than previously thought and if such wind farms were built would warm average surface temperatures over the continental by degrees celsius the direct climate impacts of wind power are instant while the benefits of reduced emissions accumulate slowly said keith if your perspective is the next 10 years wind power actually has in some respects more climate impact than coal or gas if your perspective is the next thousand years then wind power has enormously less climatic impact than coal or gaskudos to the reds on this onelots of them in nebraska it s great to see how much additional reinforcement support the local farmers have put into their abortion stops a beating heart signs just so their turbines won t blow them away ok fine we ll profit off of green energy but we re still blood red republicans don t forget itwell is that interesting considering the blue states are normally the ones toting green energyin the red state where i live people howl any time a new turbine is being installedlol they ll all be saying this is going to give them cancerif they could read they would be so pissedthey will absolutely use this against the democrats were making solar and wind power happen when the libs couldnani sure the debate is whether a one missile test or a two missile test will do the trickin announcing the meeting in february kcna said it was a very important and urgent task to establish the correct strategy for the development of agriculture literally the best thing the north korean government can do is to stop trying to establish the correct strategy for the development of agriculture at the last party meeting nk concluded they could improve their agriculture by transforming the thought of agricultural workers and enhancing their political awareness in other words by wasting farm workers time with more party propaganda and indoctrination sessions https so much of north korea food insecurity is due to the fact that they still try to maintain a highly centralized inefficient cold war era collective farming system which even the vietnamese and cubans abandoned decades ago they just need to back off and let farmers do their own thing set their own prices and sell their own food if they want to increase agricultural productivity in north korea httpsguess you ca eat weapons testsfatty needs to feed the peopleso is everyone

likeremovednani think it was in 2020 or 2021 but suddenly instagram started suggesting stories of disasters in the explore tab cruise ships rolling over and passengers sliding down the sides planes crashing fires buildings crumbling avalanches overtaking climbers i stopped looking at the explore tab for a couple months and it returned to showing women with big boobs and very long nails even though i a gay they def were drag queens ca winsure but at least they instantly ban anyone who shows a nippleit s their algorithms they are totally messed up i keep getting fed images of people jumping off things i m afraid of falling so i m sure at some point i paused in horror at one such post instagram just responds by showing me more of what horrifies me it s a terrible way to gage what people want to see you can stop on a post and select an option to not see content like this i ve easily done that 50 plus times on falling videos there s fewer now but they still creep in sometimes they really need to redo their algorithms i just want to look at cute kittens and people hiking is that too much to askmines full of mountain bikes bottoms and boobsyep one that used to be ocean life started showing animal torturethat s funny mine is almost entirely advertisementsi noticed the trolly conservatives on twitter are posting more fight videos and other forms of retaliatory violence and justice served type videos it obvious that it a coordinated effort or they are collectively desensitizing their followers to more violence mtg pushing for national divorce oh i also use the thicker aluminum foil if anyone interested loli getting cat videoswhich is the greater threat artificial intelligence or the weaponization of social media to spread stupidity hatred and misinformationthe article says they posting gore to promote onlyfans and that people are piggybacking on the posts to promote child pornography not only that but the driving force behind the trend is children engaging in grind and clout culture by marketing the content to other children wow large meme accounts post the graphic content to reels in an effort to boost engagement meme administrators and marketers said they then monetize that engagement by selling sponsored posts primarily to agencies that promote onlyfans models the higher a meme page s engagement rate the more it can charge for such posts these efforts have escalated in recent months as marketers pour more money into meme pages in an effort to reach a young highly engaged audience of teenagers marketers said w ithout instagram providing the framework it wouldn t enter into someone s mind let s put a rape video up because it boosts they re willing to do anything to boost those numbers more children are seeking to leverage the internet early for financial and social gain usually when you start a meme account you re in middle school maybe a freshman in high school that s the main demographic for meme pages those younger teens it s super easy to get into especially with the culture right now where it s the grind and clout culture originally these pages would use sexual content to grow he said but they soon transitioned to use gore content to grow their accounts even quicker these gore reels have very high engagement there s a lot of people other comments below graphic videos promoted child porn groups on the messaging app telegram in telegram chats viewed by the post the administrators for large meme accounts traded explicit material and coordinated with advertisers seeking to run ads on the pages posting graphic content buying ads from pages only read a post from one advertiser the primary way these sorts of meme accounts monetize is by selling sponsored posts to onlyfans these meme page audiences are year olds so the people who run the page are young it seems like we re raising a generation of adolescent grifters who will grow up having a totally skewed relationship of how to be ethical and make a living at the same time she said this is not normal and it s not okay for young people to be exposed to it much less be profiting from iti following all the wrong influencersi get all those terrible

liveleak got deleted or reddit killing off almost all gore subs it s really not content that anyone wants to see in the general sense anyway the last time i think people should ve been seeing stuff like this was a year ago in ukraine when innocent people were being murdered or journalism in general other than that it s making entertainment out of dead people which is just sadi saw a video of

financial gainthere are safe countries closer to these people that do require crossing an oceanthis is really heart breaking but nothing we can really do it seems that this is going to happen again and again our planet is overcrowded and only more and more people are going to die this way or another this planet ca sustain 8b people living western europe standards with current technology and power generating capabilities it not fair to close doors to happy life for others but it also not fair to accept random illegal migrants to the better world leaving everyone else hopeless migration must be controlled at all costs regardless of human tragedy emotions can really take over logic and this is what causes those tragedies i wonder if merkels invitation caused more suffering than any good more people are displaced and thinking there place for them elsewhere instead of trying to make best of what they have where they live brain drain and healthy young people leaving is only making it worse for future generationsnantil that australia has mardi gras paradesthe float she threw herself in front of was not even a police float but a float for nsw lgbtq community services whatever your thoughts on police being involved in mardi gras celebrations she chose a terrible way to protest itfor those outside australia she recently defected from the greens the most progressive out of mainstream parties so she can pursue her narcissistic and histrionic ambitions she also forgot to disclose her personal relationship with an ex bikie while she was on some law and order committee aussies have another 5 years of her indulgenceremoved from a mardi gras parade a real sign of classalways that one person simple parade everyone seems happy and welcome gay and hetero people dancing together people of all races seemingly singing fun campfire songs police wearing their best outfits all is going well then the inevitable drama bitch rolls in and shits in the punch bowlamericans really just do understand foreign politics lolso glad the greens gave her the bootfor a person who talks about supporting the lgbt community she sure likes to make it about herselfpolice have been one of the biggest enemies of lgbt people since forever the only reason cops had a float in that parade was to launder their image they should not have been there she did the correct thingweird redditors think protestors should protest away and out of sight how the fuck is that supposed to work i m sorry you couldn t enjoy your hurricane while watching very slow and colorful cars go byshe seems pretty flipping cool to me fuck 12 and anyone who defends themso she protested momentarily stopped a float and was asked to leave and did so wowpursuit of happiness ring a bell she had no right to stop a public paradewhile i totally agree with her position on the matter of cops this was not the time and place for thatdid she flash her goodswait so protesting the police is bad nowis the aus green party anything like the us green party because if they are she not a serious person and is likely a disruptive plant who is only there to make progressives look bad through performative satire and juvenile antics such as thisis someone gon na send her a memo that mardi gras is basically a catholic holiday should be boycotting mardi gras instead imo mardi gras is literally just fat tuesday with extra indulgencethis arrest should get her tons of likes on her ig page way to show how much you carethey let the pigs have a float in a parade for people that are abused by pigs a lot of the time no wonder she did like thatgod damn it this country is getting stupid as shitnanfor real this time you guysit be nice if both sides can make it stickso is israel shutting down settlements is palestine ending financial support of the families of terrorists i like the words but they seem to be emptyin a real politick sense the palestinian people in both the west bank under the pa and the gaza strip under hamas has constantly refused to acknowledge and deal with the fact that they have lost multiple wars and uprisings against israel this has been happening since the 1940 s it s sucks to be a defeated country and people but after agreeing to surrender terms and ceasing hostilities it allows a country to rebuild and develop the constant state a resistance has been dragged out for too long even other arab countries are over it and establishing official bilateral relations with israel the sad thing is that now a days the voting populace of israel is just fed up with the supposed peace process specifically young voters are turning away from it and supporting far right politicians cause all they see from the palestinians is constant rhetoric about destroying israel it s a sad state of affairs that i honestly don t see being resolved ever due to a variety of reasonsfinance minister bezalel smotrich who also has responsibilities over jewish settlements in the west bank quickly said he would not abide by any such agreement i have no idea what they spoke about or not in jordan smotrich wrote on twitter but one thing i do know there will not be a freeze on the building and development in settlements not even for one day it is under my authority well then this effort is doomed to fail the faction that desperately wants to complete the original settler colonial project is going to sabotage this peace deal at all costs israel s conservatives have allowed the a lot of influence within their coalition in exchange for holding power and now it s playing out exactly like everyone else knew it wouldwe promise to throw one less brick still has a pile of millions of bricksremovedright and whos taking bets on who will or wont follow throughcool because dozens of similar pledges have helped tremendously in the past oh waitanyone else thinking of the spy vs spy picture where they shaking hands and holding bombs and things behind their backsit been over 70 fucking years it time to establish israel borders and make them stay inside of them like every other nation on earth offer not valid in atmgood idea shame they had thought of trying it before nownanso ya thought ya might like ta go to the showearlier this month waters former pink floyd bandmate david gilmour shared a tweet of his partner and who was a band songwriting partner writer polly samson in which he hurled harsh accusations at waters unfortunately you are antisemitic to the core of your rotten bones he wrote also supports putin and is a liar thief hypocrite tax raiser lipsync misogynist jealous megalomaniac enough with your nonsense gilmore who since waters left pink floyd in the serves as the leader of the band shared the aforementioned tweet and wrote every word is true without a doubt i have a feeling that gilmour knows waters better than just about anyone there s a reason they don t perform togetherit s so weird to grow older and see these monolithic heroes turn shriveled and sourthe council also condemned waters for his support of the bds campaign that calls for boycotting israel and for the pressure he exerted on other artists not to perform in israel i mean that d nothing you can decline to support israel and encourage others to stop supporting it not supporting israel doesn t mean that you re i m so tired of people conflating israel they also emphasized the use of antisemitic imagery in waters performances one of which includes a balloon in the shape of a pig with a star of david printed on it alongside a host of corporate logos oh well that s really not good yeah this guy in an extensive interview with the telegraph newspaper earlier this month waters said that he believes that ukraine is run by nazis and that it is not really a country alright fuck this guyroger definitely does lip synch his way through concerts i went to his vancouver show and witnessed him miss his queue his voice rang out strong and clear while the microphone was nowhere near his mouth his deer caught in the headlights expression immediately afterwards would have been more funny if i hadn t paid 250 to actually see a live showwaters is an insufferable boobgood he a self absorber self entitled megalomaniac pure utter cunt that thinks he better than everyone else thinks the sun shines out of his arse and that he somehow now the only person capable of ever making music in pink floyd and now claims that he was the only person to create write any of floyd music in the past note his recent attempt to rerelease dark side of the moon and claim it entirely all his work and not a single other member of floyd was ever involved nothing other than a sad fucking deluded megalomaniac washed up has been that deserve to be forgotten and removed from any form of stage or limelightroger waters made some great music but morally he can kiss my assdavid and polly are 100 spot on and it hurtsin 2013 rabbi abraham cooper the associate dean of the jewish human rights organisation the simon wiesenthal center accused waters of antisemitism for including a giant pig balloon bearing a star of david in his concerts 129 130 waters responded that it was one of several religious and political symbols in the show and not an attempt to single out judaism as an evil force 125 later that year waters compared the israeli treatment of palestinians to nazi germany saying the parallels with what went on in the 1930s in germany are so crushingly obvious 125 he said the reason why few celebrities had joined the bds movement in the united states was because the jewish lobby is extraordinary powerful here and particularly in the industry that i work in the music industry 131 132 following the remarks the league concluded that waters was antisemitic https israeli e2 80i do know i was really drunk at the timeroger needs an education roger needs some thought controlwhen i saw waters perform at desert trip i remember him making passing comments about random shit that was totally out of pocket he s in the same camp as morrissey in my mind now just completely out of his mind and not worth paying any attention toroger waters is an old bitter tankie lately he was complaining because the weekend s upcoming concert was getting more buzz in a newspaper and saying how he was so much more important to music yes pink floyd was great but he was only a part of ityou either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain thanks for adding another example rogerfor all those idiots that are saying he is just and supports palestinian freedom he publicly said he believes a certain jewish billionaire is a puppetmaster controlling american politics that s not supporting palestine that s a conspiracy and is he also supports russia s invasion of ukrainegilmour is truly my idol he is and always will be pink floydhe s not only an he s denies russia s genocide against ukrainiansi like how people are defending waters without even realizing the crap he been saying for a while or people are ignoring these statements on purpose in an extensive interview with the telegraph newspaper earlier this month waters said that he believes that ukraine is run by nazis and that it is not really a country referring to the conflict between it and russia the former pink floyd singer added that the claim that russia invasion happened after there was no provocation is f ing crazy and he also said that in his opinion some of the criticism of russian president vladimir putin is unfair the guy has lost his mindhe also pro russia a week before the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine waters told an rt interviewer that the talk of an attack was bullshit and propaganda demonising russia 147 waters said the us president joe biden was fuelling the fire in the ukraine that is a huge crime and asked why the us does not encourage ukraine to negotiate obviating the need for this horrific horrendous warstrange venn diagram overlap anti israel and pro putinnothing like a good roger gilmour pissing contest i a team david floyd fan so i approve of this cancellationroger waters does need paper towels he just self absorbedremovedgood fuck him he s a sack of shit of a human beingtalk about throwing away your legacycould happen to a nicer assholeeven his band mates have had enough of his shit earlier this month waters former pink floyd bandmate david gilmour shared a

leader of the band shared the aforementioned tweet and wrote every word is true without a doubtlive long enough to see your hero become psychoticits bad when germans say youve gone too farah relieving the pastfwiw i was unaware of all the controversy around rw and bought pretty expensive tickets to see him at madison square garden last year it was almost entirely about politics nonstop politics including a video of people being murdered by police officers which i absolutely did not need to see i do not recommend his show in related news i am going to see a cover band do a full dark side of the moon show in my town next month and am very excited about itgood the guy is a total asshole and it is about time people stood up to himor state is notabout time he started getting publicly called out for it last time i saw the accusation on reddit people were defending him as merely it a crock of shit he antisemitic through and throughisrael is committing effectively a genocide against the palestinian people and that should be silencedthe american nick rivers will be taking his placethere s a reason why they say you should never meet your heroes unfortunately this asshole keeps doubling down on his antisemitism and putin loving nonsenseha ha charade you are rogerdeletedi feel like judging by the posts in this thread he ca be an because he is just the fact that someone is doesn t absolve him of being anfor all i care roger waters can go kanye himselfend israel s apartheid state free palestinei mean he s and but that doesn t mean he is antisemitic i saw the balloon it wasn t just a star of david it had crucifix christianity and the crescent moon islam too this is a very biased news report and more people need to engage is basic research and critical thinking bds is in support of palestineopposing israel is antisemetism but i definitely skeptical of anyone who opposes israel while supporting russia in ukrainethe sad reality is some of our most cherished song writers artists and performers are who they are because of their personal struggles if roger and likely gilmore et al wasn t quite so self absorbed quite so opinionated quite so extreme we may never have experienced his and their art the vast majority of us seem to fall more in the middle of the curve we live our lives have jobs and friends and maybe a but we don t influence the masses because our personalities our psychology just isn t quite as extreme not saying waters isn t being a prick but i certainly appreciate his i just try to ignore him while doing soisrael sucks we re allowed to take issue with israel and not be antisemiticbeing opposed to israel and being antisemitic are two different thingshe was cancelled because he supports palestinian right to life and freedom he is not a but a many jews are anti zionistis there a bot army pushing these jpost articlesanother one of my childhood idols outed to be an assholeand if the band youre i starts playing different tunes i ll see you on the dark side of the moonwaters became what he wrote about a long time ago and it s just plain saddeletedwaters clapton and van should put together a super wankers group for this summer tourfinally waters is a fucking dumbassrw criticises the human rights violations of apartheid israel that does not make him an anti semitepeople were fine with him when it was just now that it s also rhetoric everyone is calling him out for that and throwing the in as a cherry on topi have seen roger waters perform six times over the past 20 years in the usa never once did he come across as anything but peace loving and most definitely scared off his ass of nuclear war never met the man personally but the man is most definitely not propagating hate with his performances not rooting for a side in senseless war violence doesn t mean he is anti the people of that countrydeletedhave fun playing shows exclusively in communist countries you gooni have seen rog at least a dozen times since the early 80 s i always put up with his political bullshit as he is brilliant and his dad died in wwii his rhetoric over the last couple years is just insane i can t give him any more of my money and even for free i can t listen to his bullshit rock stars should play music and shut the fuck up about politicsa shame germany didn t take this stance 80 years agoah that s right he s labelled an antisemite because he doesn t like how the israelis have treated palestinians how does that make him an anti semite has he said anything nastydeletedthis guy has always had a bad attitude because his dad died in wwii gfy clownthis man is automatically a hero for supporting bds if you can t delineate antisemitism from maybe ask yourself if you re part of the problemmaybe i shouldn t be surprised but i am he seemed smarti wouldn t go that far out of fear of getting banned from reddit but he is truly stupidwaters expressing his opinion on the ways of the world doesn t make him a the man s a genuine humanitarian who hates war of all kind it s in his music it s in his interviews the narratives are not controlled by him he always tells his interviewers to read a book referring that what he s saying isn t made up it s documented history just pick up a book and see for yourself the no i prefer sound bytes and s as my source of genuine information yea i ll stay on the side of things read stuff with real facts and actual ground work done to prove it if your still in denial about it you just don t have a human side and that s ok in this day and age it s been taken for most sentient beingsah were just throwing words at people again because they dont agree with usnandon t worry guys some rich people are making lots of money and they like money more than youif anyone is interested in reading some basic info about the transportation of hazardous waste httpsepa was gutted during we were told we did need water that was so clean it hurt businessplaces with waste disposal facilities did know they would be used to dispose of wastethis just seems weird why would a hazardous waste disposal site call offices if politicians to tell them what type of waste is coming ofc the politicians weren t aware the water and soil was being transported there just like everything else ever shipped there this event is a huge issue and many people in ohio and surrounding areas will pay the price for many many years what we don t need is deadbeat politicians in other states to make this disaster about themlike all the other remediation disposalscontaminated soil from the derailment site was being taken to the us ecology wayne disposal in belleville michigan us debbie dingell of michigan said friday she told cnn s fredricka whitfield on saturday that neither she nor michigan gov gretchen whitmer were aware of plans for toxic waste to be delivered to disposal sites in her district you did know that this particular toxic waste was going to that disposal site but when your district has a toxic waste disposal site at all you kind of have to expect to have some nasty shit taken there from time to timenot that they did know so much as they did know they would be called out on it its a danger not only to the town where the disaster occured but anywhere else they might send the stuff the next time your uncle on facebook starts going on about how the epa is some kind of commie plot remember to link him this articleso how bout the major rail yards across the country after working in them for 20yrs let me tell you those are toxic waste dumps in of themselves i have witnessed 100s of gallons of diesel fuel dump straight to the ground because a fuel pump handle stuck while fueling locomotives 45yrs ago all rail tankers cars had leaks over time some of those yards are a hundred years or morebro belleville has even had power since wednesday and they trying to dump this shit on us the can gtfothe article is bullshit click bait the officials cited are not officials that are part of the process one is a county judge and the other a state the facilities the waste was transported to are official places to process this type of waste show me that the required paperwork was filled and the applicable state agencies notified then it would mattermichigan and ohio have massive us ecology disposal centers we send all our chromium laced hazardous material to both of these centersso basically ns made the decision to ship the contaminated material to tx and mi without telling the epa or anyone else for that matter as to what their plan was oh great communication skills all around not holy crap we live in such a screwed up world these days no common sense and no accountabilitythey should deliver it to the boards homes insteadgee did anyone ask the texas officials how it feels to have something transported to them without them being prepared to handle it funny now that the shoe is on the other footwhat did you think would happen when you gut environmental safety regulationsoh sorry texas perhaps we should have announced we were putting the water on a bus and dropping it off at the governor mansionbecause these states have crap waste disposal facilities due to crap state laws that allow toxic waste like that to be disposed there the public is just too dumb to realize it caught up in owning the libs to vote rationallycorporations don t have jurisdictions corporations are also people it s better to be a corporation than it is to be a personsounds like clickbait and politicians being opportunistic i signed a number of manifests from past derailments to send haz waste up to designated hazardous waste disposal facilities in michigan once waste is determined to be hazardous the legal documentation and logistics becomes an order of magnitude harder to dispose of i also doubt that jurisdictions need to be notified of every waste shipment but does that make for a great articletexas officials over here griping about a drop in the bucket while they regularly let oil and gas businesses pollute every drop off water and spit of soil in this statepaying to keep the peace is a helluva lot cheaper than wagingis it normal to have to notify officials that you doing water and soil testsright i didn t know just trying to keep my job and turn a blind eyenow you know congratsfuture wars well be fought over clean water not oilnothing logic or science could have told youthere is some land near cederville oh that it can be deliveredeveryone else in the room bullshit coughtexas knew but our politicians are upset because someone did take them out to the austin club and leave a thick envelopetexas has almost no regulatory oversight they only going oh golly gee wiz we did know about that because the ohio disaster is all over national news and people are dying left and right and social media was already buzzing about it moving down the river to begin with nevermind all the toxic waste dumps and factory pollution thoughthe epa chose not to intervene so why is everyone surprised if the epa had wanted to they could have taken control of the entire area and operations for remediation day one from the article until friday norfolk southern had been solely responsible for the disposal of waste generated by the east palestine train derailment the department said but waste disposal plans will be subject to epa review and approval moving if left to their own devices companies are going to figure out the most cost effective way to get rid of all this material if that means shipping to texas or even out do the country that what they will do the epa can force them to dispose of the material at certain locations force them to draw up comprehensive testing and remediation plans done by dozens of engineers force them to excavate and suck the material from water in a meticulous and expensive fashion but chose not to up until yesterday this has been a shit show both by the rail company and the epa which is a fucking sad considering i had such high hopes for the agency under this administrationvery surprised that texas still believes in regulation and govt to know that something like this is happeningdo let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966 al bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the polk high school panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus andrew johnson high school including the touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis spare tire dixontexas 100 knows those fucking assholes are playing dumbhave these gop governors been involved in shipping hazardous waste to other states in the pastwas a shit train to texas an episode of billionsthis is how deregulation works embrace it do look now but your owning the libsthey should just rent a bus and dump it at gov greg abbott s doorstepmaybe politicians from ohio should load up busses full of toxic soil and dump them in random texas cities with no so that texans can bear their fair burden of the crisis oh wait that s only valid when our governor wants to exploit people for his political gain greg abbottit s almost as if pollution is a national problemharris county texas is one of those places that may be underwater due to global warming putting contaminated water that close to the ocean is problematic with the oil industry harris county probably already has many weird chemicalskinda like how the officials in new york chicago and didn t know displaced migrants would be transported into their jurisdiction from texasso texas you sent refugees to other jurisdictions without informing how does it feelalmost as though these people should be deciding on ecosystem bills if they do know how it workswait till they find out what happens when that stuff takes the ohio river to the mississippi and out to thealternate headline texas and michigan officials are either lying or inept at their jobsah the old not on my land not my problem oh shit it is my problemmi resident here i grew up close to a dump that s less than an hour away from canada and it s pretty common knowledge that we ve been receiving hazmat waste from our canadian brothers for a long time it s always infuriated me but what are we supposed to dothe wheel bearing was literally on fire for 20 miles the crew chose or were told not to stop and inspect it this is a norfolk southern nightmare i do believe the hot box detectors did go off but they may have been not maintained and broken again ns faultreally you did know or you did care when some rich company convinced you it was okay before and now it backfiredbut texas its ok to bus migrants to nycthis would be a great time for buttigeig to be more vocal and transparent i would love to see him fighting against transferring the danger from one backyard to another this would be the time to point out how wrong it is to not inform other states that the waste is being dumped in their yards to stand up and say this is wrong perhaps illegal to just dump wherever they want without notifying anyone if he cared if he was there to get the actual job done why are we not hearing any concern or outrage against this practice not hearing the voices of residents coming out of his mouth this is so wrong our elected officials have failed usf texas want deregulation want to support trump and the republican party s gutting of the epa in here are the enjoyreally sucks michigan has to deal with thisis mr

on cowboy hatsrailroads do whatever the fuck they want there is some darkness within that needs a a lighthow do you not understand flowing waterliteralnanthe article does frame this as a feel good story the way most people in the comments assumed it did it goes into how more elderly people are being forced out of retirement and the original fund raiser post flat out says that it horrible that they had to do this just how do people expect these stories to be reportedthey look miserable for good reasonthese stories are supposed to elicit good feelings but all i ever feel is depressed that people in america need to keep relying on fundraisers for basic services and dignities that other western countries handle as matters of public policyanother way to phrase it high school students had to raise money so that a person who was underpaid for decades at his prior jobs could retire a third way to phrase it landlords raise an old man rent and literal children had to pay it offthis story lays bare the harsh reality that american social safety net is broken and one party wants to break it even more senator rick scott a guy whose corporation oversaw the largest fraud in history released a so these programs would need to be by congress every five yearsi think the intent of the story was feel good but this is damn depressing as it shows the state of affairs in the us currentlythat is not how retirement is supposed to work but i get the feeling we be seeing more of it first it was gofundme for medical bills now it for retirement i guess the poors need to plan on being photogenic enough to get to survive after their bodies give out seems like a sustainable planbut it heartening how they raised money so an underpaid man working all his life did have to clean up bathrooms til he died and not another dystopian hellscape story worded prettily at all next we get to hear of a five year old who worked 5 hours after school and during daylight at weekends to paid of lunch debt so his classmates could eat at least one got meal a day see lovely storythis is more if a sad story than a good the most powerful country in the world has its citizens starvingwhat if we as a nation took care of our seniors so that everyone did have to work in their golden yearsfor more inspiring stories like this one seeif u can retire off 260k i would be retired already except that not really viable anywhere even in 3rd world countries nowadaysthis is happy news it a dystopian society painted in pretty colorscool let s do this for every dirt poor teacher toothat money can last for the rest of his life if he leaves the countrythis isn t a heartwarming story what these kids did is incredible but it s really fcked that the custodian wasn t able to retire without that help the economic system is a failure and the american dream is deadthis is an embarrassing and not a feel good storymeanwhile ceo sitting on record profits i do want to be a communist but like something needs to changewhat a tragic headlineretirement programs so terrible in us burden falls on high school kids to raise money for elderly janitor s security fixed it for you late stage capitalism trying to be packaged as a feel good story we need a better systemthis is super depressing good on the kids but wow i hate this countryour system is so shitty that kids are stepping up to assist the elderly the system is broken so that a few ultra rich can get another boat or fund the expansion to the golf coursei know such situations are suppose to be positive but it really a reflection on how horribly our society has evolvedthe saddest part about this is that isn t even enough to retirewow this country is a parody of itselfthis is a nice or moving story this just goes to show just how shit the us is nowthese should not be feel good stories these stories show how broken our system isthis is not the feel good story you think it isreally nice of them to help this individual we need a system where retiring in dignity is normal and does require a one off situation of goodwill it more valuable than people being allowed to hoard billions of dollarsthat is not enough to retire lol but that still rules good for themoh another perseverance porn storysome adults wonder why so many kids are checked out this is what they see the kids know this american dream isn t what society wants them to believethis is not as easy as it looks my sister is an english teacher in mexico she has a brain tumor and we just needed to raise we raised like 45 i ended up letting gofundme just refund the money to the people who donated these kids must have seriously worked together to make this happenthere nothing positive about this story countless innocent victims of the fucked up system are still having to rely on the rare kindness of strangers to have some sort of living standard that should been a thing long ago unless this elderly person is in massive debt which i see no indication of i guess it a bittersweet ending but i just mad there are probably many others that are just as luckythe retirement home is going to be thrilled to get their claws on whatever is left after taxesthis is a feel bad story disguised as a feel good story why do people have a decent pension in this country like they do in the other g8 industrialized nationsyay socialism and support are bad but children paying for a man retirement is great this is a good news storythis is a real life horror story this is a public employee essentially living on starvation wages we are so shitty to each other on this countrythere a man in a blue suit and briefcase at his doorheartwarming children raise money to save other children from the orphan crushing machinesystem so they have still moneythis is wonderful to hear but how many other custodians were saved in this manner our social security system is failing the people who most need itthe irony that the next blurb on that news site is billionaire financier thomas lee dies at age 78 sure these highschooler helped one dude but there 8000 other people who could be helped by this snapple guy dying but their family asks for privacyit makes me happy to see that top comments here are about how not feel good at isas others have said happy to see that others read this as seriously messed up rather than a feel good story it s great that these kids did more than just complain on social media but i hope they will also vote when they are ableplot twist they really hated him and needed him gonethat s just great to see these kids were raised rightbut if they just give him free money he never learn to work hard and pull himself up by the bootstrapsfeel good story yay capitalismthat what a fucked up system looks likeits a shame that people only get to retire during their least active years i seen many elderly people retire and then sit at home all day only to pass away within a yearcrosspost to in 3 2 1this is what counts as a feel good story jesus the poor guy by merit at least this calls to attention how many senior citizens can not retirethis is not a good story this is a horrific story sign of a failed state that you can not even take care of the people who make it runi despise stories like this just like how so many of us americans have to use gofundme to pay for unexpected medical costs it sad and not endearingit s preposterous social security and medicare can t cover retirees cost of livinganother day another dystopic news storythis is not an uplifting story this is a horror showthese stories give me hope for the future it seems like the younger generations have empathy which older generations seem to lackalright now what if we do this for everyone and maybe the people with the most money can put the largest portion toward this fundi would kms if some students had to pay my employees retirement because i a piece of shit that ca pay a living wagethis is not a fucking feel good story we need change these kids should never have to do something like thisthere it that funnywow it s like if we had a system that would take people money and give it to people after a certain age so they retirethis is dystopia shit stop celebrating thislandlord of the old guy oh so he rich now good for me i raise his rent further thank you high school seniors for my new car lovehuh been seeing leaking into other subreddits for a while nowit so very sad that you live in a society that needs to do thisthis is great but also sadly tells districts that if they decide to cut costs and fuck with people retirements then the problem will resolve itselfi really really really hope these students learned the right lessons from thisdoes he pay taxes on that money come tax time if so then that fucking sucksmy parents are in their 70s and still working and will prob work until they die i feel bad for themwelcome to the capitalist hellscapethis should be in awfuleverythingshouldn t this be what social security and forced company pension jobs are formight be hope for today youths to become the leaders of tomorrow well donethis is a sad story as a millennial this makes me terrified for my future as a seniorhow unbelievably dystopianthis is capitalist dystopian fodder nice on the kids thome but when will i get to retire gop that the best part you do with how health care is ran in the us one bad accident or disease can render you penniless no matter how much you saved my mom put 15 of her check for years into her 401k it got decimated in the housing crises and 200k she put in wiped out she doubled down and by the time she retired 14 years later at 64 back in 2021 it was at about 350k now her and her husband have health issues my mom is worried about it but i had a look at her bank statements and funds at the rate she is going she will run out in another years retirement does exist for anyone expect the top 10 and even some of them get hosedi got called a dumbass for saying we had a broken system if students are raising money to help a man retire they were all like what if he was good financially i like so you think this gon na help lolthis is what taxes are meant to pay for relying on fundraisers to survive is insane americakids do something our government ca awesomea very nice gesture from these studentsso in another years he can retire good job kidsreminder that republicans are the party that wants to cut social security and eliminate pensions both parties are not the same on this issuethe same people who think this is a feel good story are dead set against socialism and actively work against guarantying every elderly person the same dignity security and comfort if these kids were running the world it would be a better place and it sure as hell wouldn t be capitalistthere just no way that enough to retire ongreedy landlord subsidized by children allowance money ftfy cbsin other words an 80 year old man was forced to work far too long by a school district that wouldn t pay him enough these kinds of stories aren t cute wholesome or warm fuzzy all these stories do is prove what a shithole of country we live inchildren work and have pay for the elderly crushing machine not to crush an elderly person is this america being great your last guy supposedly made it sohow much did uncle sam takewhat the fuck is wrong with your country man everything it going to shit everything is a fucking fundraiser for people to have a decent life or to pay medical bills the feel good stories you keep pumping out just shows how fucking fucked you guys are i so sorry for you and i really hope it will not be like this forever this is not how retirement is supposed to befirst thought that s sad afwelcome to end stage capitalism americacapitalism is disgustinganother title kids are better people than the fossils in congressthis is one of them feel good about people surrendering to late stage capitalism stories can i submit a request for next month can we do a lemonade stand one those always crack me up making 7 year olds file for permits n shit bonus points if it for their mom chemocrowd sourcing to pay for a basic right workers should have already earned and the goo wants to further abolish social security programsyup my dad is 72 sanding away at wood on his feet for 8 hours a day with a bad leg and arm but he still does it is making 15 and hour and is so happy because it s the most he s ever made it breaks my heart he is worth so much more if he has to keep working labor jobs pay more he s an old man who has soooo much experience in the field i know he is in pain because he tells me so but there is nothing he can do to not work my mother who is older than him also works and makes about 20k a year for bookkeeping it s so sad i don t know what to do for them as i also make nothing basically and want to help but watch in sadness my parents still grinding the worst part is knowing that when they are in their 80s they will probably still have to work to survive that s so fucked upi wonder how much this school spends on footballah guessing we be scrolling past this story on made me smile sub and yes it a great story kudos to those kids for mopping up a shambles left behind by rampaging capitalism for real my guess is those kids unlike most of the folks whose only function appears to be keeping seats warm all over washington dc were unable to turn away so without having to wade through our festering cesspool called politics took the short cut called humanitythese kids will be the next greatest generationdeletedid like information on how to retire with thank youcapitalism is the best systemsomebody get this over to statthose kids are amazing our society on the other hand sucks massivelygreatest and most prosperous nation in human history and this is how we treat our people with ssihow many years can someone live on 260kalternate title high school students infinitely more effective than governmentjesus this country fucking sucksca really retire with 260kremoveddeletedperhaps if he had made better life choices this would not have been necessaryi don t understand how you can retire with 260k at a 4 return that s 866 month not accounting for inflation and taxes a studio apartment will rent for more than that in half the countryeven though these kids did that custodian a real solid i still maintain that school custodians should be able to open hand slap one student a yeari believe he will still be taxed on that income so he doesn t get the full amount i wonder if these kids knew this texas law i believe it i could be wrong but i don t think i amthis is what taxes are forthis is awesome i recently worked the shift at an amazon warehouse at least two of my were retirees one retired from the usps 14 years ago and the other was a retired utility company workerwhere did these kids get that much moneysetting the absolutely correct commentary on the core issue good on these kids they can t fix the problem by themselves but they did something goodanybody want to tell these kids the unfortunate truthrock the rich guys so no one has to worry about retirementthese kids look like they did it cause that had to out if the goodness of their hearts not for publicity but if it shines a light on the problem so be itnani opened this expecting this to be an award for something else that happened before this murder and they just got around to giving him the award nope got awarded for shooting an unarmed man for getting in the wrong car and taking a prescription anti anxiety medicationthis is one of the most disgusting things i ever seen the police officer acted extremely poorly and executed a man at close range and they gave the officer a purple heart award the officer should be in prison not receiving awardsi interested in protests in pueblo about this the video is so enraging it was so obvious the guy was nervous in a way that could be medical he was literally in a vehicle with 2 other adults the cop did care about that at all he did care it was an identical vehicle to the one the guy accidentally got into which in and of itself explains the whole situation nope that poor victim was unable to bite his tongue the insecure cop took it as a threat and shot an innocent unarmed person at close range like a massive coward shame on pueblo police shame on all of them for standing for this shitdid he put a bend on his badge tip as wellif this is okay then how are police not lethal threats just by approaching someonefuck and the prosecutors deemed it a justifiable murder even when the guy carried no weapons and the officer claimed he was reaching for his gun if the shooting of richard ward was justifiable i sure the shooting of mcwhorter is toothis article is so infuriating i swear we have the stupidest people in this nation for so many people to see nothing wrong in situations like this the police academies are at fault they are not teaching their students to use deadly force only as a last resort as they used to in the past now we have an epidemic of police officers around this country who are easily spooked by black men and they grab their guns and kill them needlessly this must stopi ca stand seeing the excuse the officer said he believed the suspect was reaching for his gun it honestly makes me sick it basically their get out of jail free card it nearly impossible to defend against because even if there is bodycam footage the officer only has to believe the person was reaching for his gun as someone else said here as well how can this possibly be a justified shooting when the person being shot had committed no crime and was violently assaulted by the police officercharles mcwhorter the murdereronly a true hero can mistakenly kill an innocent mancheck out the smirk on this coward clowns face moments after he shot an unarmed man 3 times in front of his mother httpsi can t believe how sick and twisted people who become cops are they re deranged maniacsthis is such a disturbing story i really hope we get to haunt people when we die this fucker should be on everyone listsee this is what happens people say we need to protest and make noise and hold them to the light when we do they do this the police double and triple down just like they did during the blm protests things just got worse it a problem we are going to be able to fix it systematic and it dug way too deepthe people in that community better worry the sheriff has declared open season on unarmed citizens to be executed for any or no reasonso let me get this right in 2018 he shoots someone a robber admittedly ten times and less than five years later he shoots someone else three times at point blank range do colorado police not know a thing about excessive forceand if we shoot back we get the electric chairhere a link to the body camera footage https it awfulafter lying on the police report saying the suspect jumped out of the vehicle when the body cam shows he was dragged out against his will give the guy an award the police have lost touch with reality and deserve the absolute worst in the united statesno one trusts cops they just going to become targetsthis is simply sickening if the facts are what is stated clearly in this article then this man was murdered for no reason when did it become a guilt before innocent law so many cops are too trigger happy it s a freakin scary world out there especially if cops are getting medals for killing unarmed people who they seem to have provoked let s kill someone for taking a pill illegal or not i m not saying what it was either way does not deserve a death sentence fire the chief and arrest the officersthe victim says i don t like that was the motive for the murderpretty soon they ll have awards for best killing of an unarmed person and best cover story and most abuse of power and best use of stop resisting against an innocent person etcthis is working exactly how they want it tothis could be me i am extremely uncomfortable around law enforcement people and have anxiety for which i have a prescription and i carry a small pill box on my keychain with my anti anxiety med in it absolutely terrifying what in the blasted fuck is going on with american cops shayzuss they need a whole lot more psych evaluations before they re accepted into the academy and while in the academy a fuckload of training for how to volatile situations which often involve mentally illearned the purple heart no no i think he did not do that he very likely received one but he did not earn a purple heartwell they just following the example of prior officers in this case the ones who helped jeffrey dahmer do not call police for help unless you are okay with someone or everyone at the scene being killed i would only call for a violent crime as a reminder this is not normalterrorise a poor guy suffering from anxiety partly from having been traumatised by people just like you in the past he so terrified by you that he takes an anxiety med in the moment to get some relief you take that as a signal to beat him and then shoot him to death at point blank range he is a murderer he should be put in prison so they give him a purple heart award absolutely fucking disgustingcitizen kills a member of law enforcement death penalty law enforcement executes unarmed citizen awardit so dangerous to have mental illness in americacan we all call the mayors office and make a complaintfuck no just fuck no this story makes me scared to go outside fuck nothis story is fucking infuriatinghe got a purple heart for injuries sustained in the shooting one of those injuries was an injured forefinger did he strain his trigger pulling fingerthat kid he was picking up is going to grow up killing copsfuck that sheriff and fuck that deputy someone should shove that reward up their asses they pussieslocal prosecutors ultimately deemed mcwhorter s killing of ward as justified it wild that this shit is not considered a systemic issue in the us the local prosecutor office should never be the ones responsible for whether or not charges are brought the conflict of interest is incredibly obviousamerican police knowingly kill more unarmed citizens than any other western nations kills armed police are taught to wrestle at the slightest bit of resistance and the second they are in any physical contact they can fear they lose their gun and execute the individual hell they put a gun to the back of a guys head and blew his brains out with that claim not too long ago escalation to the extreme is not in the citizens interestswhat the absolute fuckthe country is a fucking nightmare jesus christi can t imagine what it s like to be the person that called the cops on him did you get what you wanted now if something is stolen from me i will be scared to call for help because i would want my wallet back and the person to deal with charges and have it on their record for like 6 months after good for the person to effing die i mean good godthe rise of the vigilante is just around the cornerwild west this sheriff or deputy would have been tried and hanged if the people didn t get him firstonly articles about cops would make me read headlines multiple times because of how little sense they make mcwhorter later claimed that he feared ward was trying to reach for his gun and local prosecutors ultimately deemed mcwhorter s killing of ward as justified though it turned out he did have any weapon at all fucking degenerates the is probably the only developed country where nonsense like this would fly on a regular basiscolorado sheriff proud to have a murderous coward as a deputy there i fixed the titleon top of how horrific this is what in the stolen valor is giving a cop a purple heart being a cop is not a military post stop treating it as such not only is it disrespectful to actual military and vets but it damaging to the police force when they see themselves as warriors and soldiers and not public fucking servants not to mention soldiers are far better at following roi and not shooting civilians when they are told not toit not inherently illegal to take pills even if you are taking an illegal pill form drug the penalty is death this was murder by the police straight upf k every single one of these pigs until the good pigs start arresting the overwhelmingly pigs i don t want to hear a word about well most of them are ok bullshit pigs defend and cover up for pigs and if you cover up criminal acts you yourself are a criminal and don t forget it is your tax dollars that fund these payouts that the piglice make for wrongful death suits pigs don t pay for their crimes in any way shape or formthis world is going to hell fast makes me feel a little at ease with my failing health get me the hell outta this shitholestuff like this is going to come to a very violent head as lack of accountability and outright murder go unchecked i feel the worst is yet to comei sorry but this is so fucked up a young man is dead and this pos gets an award this guy should be in jail where the hell is the fbijesus is there a single cop who isnt scum at this pointevery cop in america who says nothing about incidents like these is a murderer by association fuck the policebonus for removing someone from the retirement fundafter he murders fixed it for yai d like to take this opportunity to remind you to never speak to officers in the line of dutyjust one bad rightmaybe he can become a school resource officer since he so quick on the draw i mean he is decorated for murderbad cops how the hell do the good cops deal with this it s to the point now where anyone could be shot and killed by one and then they d get a medal for it too we have fascists right under our noseswatching the video on this one was pretty devastating the officer yanks him out of the car for him taking a pill and tries immediately wrestling him to the ground then shoots him a couple of times with his mother still in the car in the seat directly in front of him you can hear her screamingthe police want you deadfolks we have entered bizarro worldremovedit important to notice richard opened the door to talk to the police do engage or willingly talk to the police in any event ever it will never help you httpsdeletedthis myth that police are protecting us and are underpayed heroes in dangerous jobs is bullshit police work is not actually dangerous and statistics bear this out they rank 22 on the list of 25 dangerous jobs well behind delivery driver landscaper and small engine mechanic https https c2 a0 they perpetuate this false narrative to justify their controlling and violent behavior imagine if we gave the far more dangerous occupation of crossing guard the authority to use lethal force to counter any perceived threat we could arm them with glocks and they could just empty their clips into any car that was slowing down fast enough police unions are out of control years ago i worked road construction statistically a more dangerous job the lengths that we would go to to keep traffic flowing we could have shut down more lanes to put up more barriers to increase safety for the workers but the flow of traffic was a real priority it was just assumed that there was some danger inherent in our work maybe police should prioritize public safety and individual rights in the same way officer safety should not be a greater priority than the safety of the taxpaying public that they are sworn to serve and protect that called cowardicewe need to create some bots and automation that do nothing but send messages and calls to these pieces of shit and constantly remind them that no matter their lies they are murdersdisgusting this is why we hate the police fuck em allhats off to black people for actually protesting and rioting when the police kill someone from their community like this because the rest of american society does nothing when it happensmcwhorter s purple heart was at least the second time his agency had honored him for shooting a really says it all doesn t it i don t buy for one god damned minute that the kid that was so scared he took an anti anxiety medication tried to reach for the cops gun not one bitthe pueblo country sheriff office facebook page made it that you have to follow them to make comments it was that way yesterday is that a 1st amendment violationi do understand it like those school shootings completely out of character for a human being americans are speciali hate the police to many of them are violent people looking for ways to legal hurt or kill peopledid i read that wronga lot of these killings always start with a call about someone acting suspicious why are all these people so paranoid i hope they knew they got innocent people killedi thought it was a joke that the united states gave out medals for shooting black people but here it is blatant and simplejesus christ what the fuck is wrong with peoplei yell for the people in the back land of the freethey talk tough but when shit goes down it s always i feared for my life your a damn cop it s in your job description to be put in those situations for society quit being a cop thenabsolutely disgustingi wake up everyday hoping their is enough public outrage to get some criminal charges filed against the officer let alone take away the fucking medalcontrol bully gets a participation trophy i watched the video it did not have to end in a death sentencei hope this cowardly piece of trash gets what is coming to himthey sure like to rub salt on the public woundheart in the us a military decoration for those wounded or killed in action established in 1782 and in 1932 i guessing that since so many cops have transitioned from the military to law enforcement they do mind their most prestigious award being stinksthis can not fucking continue like this they think they untouchableif you are a member of the blue gang this is why you are loathed why you are hated why you are scum you support this system by being a part of it no you are there can by definition be no good ones you piece of shit you are an enemy to mankind you fucking thugpolice

person but it s just another day of murder for themthis is how supervillains get madeit does mention it in the article but i ca help but assume the victim was a black manso the sheriff killed a guy then honored a deputy cause that s kind of what the titlethat s just fucked up backwards society were living innanthese people need to be relocated end of storythe company needs to be forced to pay compensation to every single person effected and then hit with a maximum fine for environmental damagesif i litter it a crime and i punished who going to jail for this environmental disasteri used to live in east palestine i feel terrible for the community these diagnoses are just from the days following exposure we have no idea what s to come in the months and years aheadi want the ceos of norfolk in prison tired of lame fines for criminals with moneyone day we will have to have a collective talk about how our system of economic incentives is misaligned with our expectations of ethics until we do that things like this will continue to happen as they always have a good start would be getting money and lobbyists out of politicsthink of the poor shareholders and executives they need money these people want to steal their money nail the company with with maximum fines f themmy dad lives just across the state line directly in the wind path he has been experiencing headaches and respiratory problems since this startedwait years they ll all get cancer just like the situation government lying saying the is safe i expect a mass tort for these poor people in the futurethis will be one of those stories where the obvious cause of these illnesses will be denied for years until most of the victims are dead then it will be settled for pennies with enormous hoops to jump through regarding compensationthe billion dollar company that caused this should be forced to set up and fully fund a massive trust fund to pay for tbe future medical bills that will be caused by exposure to this incidentthe headline leaves wiggle room for doubt then it drops this straight away she was diagnosed with acute bronchitis due to chemical fumes according to medical records reviewed by nbc newsdon t you worry they ll be taking care of just like the ohhave a good time have fun everybody donald trump while visiting east palestinewow i been hearing the in 20 years a lot of people are going to have horrific medical consequences from this narrative i was expecting the effects to be apparent so quicklysue this company out of existencei do know when we as a society are going to learn that unfettered capitalism will bankrupt you and kill you it has been proven over and over again that businesses in america will never ever do what right the country literally is the people who live there and they would kill all of us to make a few bucks railroads should be nationalized or at the very least heavily regulated it too important to leave to reckless money grubbing assholes come on people no matter if you left or right surely you can see how bad this shit is for all of usif a corporation is a person then they should face the same consequences everyone on the board should be in jail or out on bond pending scaled consequences this is absolute bullshit have they even declared yetpeople in other countries protest and riot over less than this this has literally made a town inhabitable and nobody is doing anything about it sets a precedent that the people in this country wo actually do anything about these sorts of situationsthat just in the first few weekswhat a completely unpredictable and bizarre development leave town folks short term you have problems like this you get cancer your water and air are not safe full stopyo these people are going to need health care for the rest of their lives there no telling what sort of s is going to happen to themand the company will face a slap on the wrist while these people probably end up with cancer if they are relocated a complete disgracethe cancers will show up in a decade birth defects will appear alot soonerseriously we need to do something about the rich and i mean the rich rich not the richat this point the wealthy should be begging to be heavily taxed and regulated because those are the two least harmful things a lot of people want to happen to themsacrificed in the name of capitalismai nobody got time for thatthey ve offered eight million bucks to residents when their home values have plunged to zero nice of ns they re praying this gets out of the newscycle soon or a republican wins the whpretty sus that a news story like this is receiving so many downvotesthese people need to stop paying taxes until this shit has a reasonable resolution if they can get the local involved to prevent tax enforcement and if they can all stop using banks they have a shotno shit a chemical train derailed near themremovedno one should have to go through this mess i hope they sue the shit out of the railroad company that caused this environmental messthe cancer rates 10 years from now are what will be truly concerning these people need to sue the hell out of the train company for thisjust wait for the cancer rates to explode there in a decade or sothis is just the start of symptoms we knowhere comes the lifelong debilitating i so sad for these peopleif only east palestine would stop voting for people like us congressman bill johnson which said the following in 2016 bill johnson told a top epa official that her agency is draining the lifeblood out of our businesses through its regulations adding that i think it s absurd i think it s irresponsible i think honestly it s your department doesn t have a concern for the very people who create jobs in this httpswonder how many people will get cancer fromstop commenting and start contacting your local government none of these comments mean anything you feel exasperated because you wasting your time being dramatic online instead of doing the one thing that might make a difference post your local gov rep contact info and contact them that itlivingston la https comes to mind years for that cleanup after a vinyl chloride spill from a tran derailmentwhen reactor 4 exploded at chernobyl pripyat was evacuated after 36 hours when it became clear people were getting radiation sickness we are almost a month removed from this shit show and the people of east palestine are still therethe ny post shared a disturbing video from the residents of this community dealing with unusual ailments one poor guy voice changed and he sounds like mickey mouse so let make this perfectly clear for the residents of east palestine pack your shit and leave go literally anywhere else go live with friends or relatives until this gets handled and if you have children you should have been gone weeks agothis is going to be flint mi but worse isnt it and i mean in terms of how the local and federal government is going to handle the situationsome people will ask why did biden go to ohio this is whyvote republican more for extra cancer dosechemist here i know this is probably like pissing against a hurricane but because it s hydrogen chloride and phosgene gasses when exposed to liquid they ll make hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid respectively i suggest anyone living in the area take antacid tablets on the regular to neutralise the excess acid and help avoid damaging the stomach and digestive tract or in the case of extreme exposure charcoal powder i hope this at least helps someonewhatever this will cause huge amounts of illness birth defects and early deaths but it does matter no one will face consequences the deregulation will continue because line go up and normal people will continue to die physically or mentally to serve the money machine it not our planet the earth belongs to the shareholders and ceos who are currently killing it we just another set of resources to help fund their decadent lifestyles managed by threats of eviction starvation and violence i so tiredi wonder when the dollar amount of lawsuits levied will be greater than the lobbyist dollar value to deregulatefrom everything i read about this event it seems that the local government does give a shit about what happening there fucking lunaticsthey evacuated too small of a radius way too late everyone is taking about water etc sure that a problem but the real issue that causing all of the current health issues is the bad initial response people were evacuated until wayyyy too latethere must be a mistake governor mcgoo said the air and water was safeaint nobody got time for thatthis is just absolutely horrifichow many days did it take dewine to actually declare a state of emergencysomebody needs to pay to a handle all medical bills and proactive measures to keep every one of these people and their children healthy and b relocate them the hell out of there and extra for their troubles a lot extra this is so incredibly messed up i can t fathom the incompetence and greed shown here it s never been more clear that the people with the money do not give a single shit at allwhat a weird absolutely unrelated coincidence right guyswhere are the lawsuitsthe board of norfolk southern should be in prison and every failure in the chain of command should be tried in the courts put these criminals away it would be ludicrous if they only get fines for ohiowas already moving out of that area due to my job allowing me to work full remote got the signoff 1 week before the derailment so fortuitous timing my dog had been in ohio during my packing when i did go by the front office they asked me how my dog was i said he has been in ohio since i started this move why the lady at the front desk for the apartment complex said that good a number of house cats in the apartment complex died in the same time span right after the spill in palestine and we were worried about the little guythere is always a cost for norfolk southern to make higher profits and increase their quarterly dividend payout by 9 somebody has to pay maintenance repair and overhaul is always seen as an area where you can delay or cut expenses but it always come back to biteit s a good thing they got those maga hatsthey will still vote republicanjust wait 20 years down the road when a commericial pops up asking if you were exposed to the ohio leak and you re entitled to compensationthe people of east palestinr need help but first we need to figure out who fault this isbut local politicians drank half a glass of water before immediately leaving the area and seeking medical attention surely that means people exposed to it day in and day out will be poor i mean fine they be fine which is why they can be ignored not the poor thingeveryone here needs to get it through their thick heads that this is a problem with our political system as a whole this train was not classified as a train that needed the upgraded brakes 1 the obama administration refused to make things such as vinyl chroride as a hhfl he only made liquid petroleum something that needed the upgraded brakes 2 the trump administration repealed the brake regulations 3 the biden administration refused to put the law back on the books and proceeded to act like the derailment did even happen for 10 days read this article they one of the few places covering this well httpsfor a country full of guns we sure are a bunch of pussies for allowing this system to continuenorfolk southern hey sorry about that flings 5 dollar bill that should keep things on the down low rightthis is why we have to hold corporations to some safety laws and also strengthen the epaso what you saying is the air and water are perfectly safe sarcasmbut the rail company said it safe these residents should be happy with the 1000 checks they goti upset for every person who aware this is bad for themselves and people they care about is furious at their neighbors every year for voting republican and does have the power to rally their community to fight or the independence to leave they just victims of their surroundingsdont worry i sure their hospitals will help them land of the free rememberdid that ceo or whatever these dirtbags call themselves say it was safe now still have seen anyone from their company drink any water to confirm so until then i continue with my bottles and cans while yall fight over scraps of and midwestern economi i mean townshow is it this hard to recognize that these people need to vacaterumor has it norfolk southern is going to file for bankruptcyyou ca prove it from the incident norfolk southern probably and the courts would agree probablymore sacrifices to capitalism americas one true godsadly they ll never receive justice and the general population will never seek change in a meaningful way late stage capitalism at its finestbut i thought it was safebronchitis aint nobody got time for thati said this before but i will say it again people need to get out now the longer they are exposed to these chemicals the worse their health will get i understand that money is an issue but literally this is there lives we are talking about people need to leave now and find shelter somewhere else maybe a center in youngstown but as long as people are in the vicinity the health issues will get worse stay with family friends etc that live near by and they can stay with the government needs to relocate these people but right now the main priority should be just having the people leave east palestine for now until real tests are donei got bronchitis ai no body got time fo datwould temporary rehoming be less expensive than lawsuitsso make sure to stock up on radaway before visiting ohio got iti keep posting this and the thread keeps disappearing let s see if stays here the fire produced phosgene here s the link to the wiki on its effects httpssorry bumfuck next time don t be poornow they get to

fucked up but do worry here 5 to cure what ails youbiden could declare this a medical disaster or whatever and give all residents medicare for life automatically like obama did for libby montana it wo clean the area up but it will ensure all residents get proper medical treatment and will never see a bill for itfreight rail should be nationalized full stop it just way to critical to be run by these

railcars fears of the potential impacts are being felt in places far from the accident grocery chain giant eagle with hundreds of stores in five states including ohio and pennsylvania pulled bottled water off shelves out of an abundance of caution because it was bottled 25 miles from the derailment two high school basketball teams elsewhere in ohio forfeited games rather than venturing to the region to play more than a thousand miles away politicians rushed to assure residents anxious about firefighting wastewater from the derailment site set for disposal in texas the 3 derailment occurred when 38 norfolk southern railcars fell off the track in east palestine ohio some of those with hazardous materials catching fire three days later the railroad burned vinyl chloride from five tanker cars to avert a potential explosion the incident has raised concern from residents about the health risks near and around the village of people environmental protection agency administrator michael regan said on tuesday that the agency will order norfolk southern to pay for the necessary cleanup in east palestine ohio after one of its trains carrying hazardous materials derailed photo matt press the environmental protection agency has said the region s air and drinking water are safe and that monitoring will continue earlier this week epa administrator michael regan and other government officials drank water from the east palestine municipal water authority in a show of confidence in the federal and state environmental testing that has shown that the village water supply is safe some of the reaction in recent days to more chemical impacts has come amid people raising concerns on social media on facebook a handful of people posted questions about whether giant eagle water bottled south of east palestine was safe to drink and said they had called the company to ask the grocery chain put out a statement tuesday that it would pull water products bottled in salineville ohio about 25 miles from east palestine from store shelves the company said its water comes from a protected spring not near any affected ground water sources and that lab testing had revealed no abnormalities still it said it would pull the water sourced from the salineville facility which makes up its or larger bottled water options until further notice while health officials continue to review the impacts of the derailment marguerite parker a retired nurse in vermilion ohio 100 miles west of the derailment said she wasn t personally concerned about its impacts until she saw a news report about giant eagle she checked six gallons of water she had recently purchased for cooking and drinking on her farm and saw they had been bottled three days after the incident giant eagle grocery stores pulled bottled water off shelves because it was bottled 25 miles from the derailment who would think it s going to reach out this far the problems parker said i m not using that meanwhile concerns about breathing in the air around east palestine led two high school basketball teams to decline to play games there or elsewhere in columbiana county according to the ohio high school athletic association teams from beachwood near cleveland and bristolville forfeited tournament games when the host schools declined to move them the bristol school district attributed the decision to the concerns of families the safety of our athletes families and the community comes first and foremost it wrote on facebook in the houston area some residents of deer park texas posted online that they were rattled to discover firefighting wastewater from the incident was headed to a hazardous waste disposal facility there lina hidalgo an elected executive whose role is akin to that of a mayor said in a news conference thursday that she was taken aback to learn that some 30 trucks a day of the water had begun arriving in harris county last week she told residents her office is researching the transportation and disposal of the water to make sure it meets regulations texas molecular the company handling the firefighting wastewater has been disposing of similar hazardous water for over 40 years said jimmy bracher vice president of sales when you have an emergency it is prudent to call on an expert he wrote in an email we are proud that our expertise developed over many years can help both the country and the environment recover from this tragic accidentrelated story texas and michigan officials say they did know water soil from ohio train wreck would be transported into their jurisdictions https edit fixed link titlefirst off rate up for the article thank you i hope outrage and scrutiny continues to grow about this derailment i wo forget the offensive 25k initial self imposed fine norfolk southern right after the initial accident and i hope no one else does eitheras they should because gop wants to deregulate every single thing in every single industry nationwide so this type of shit will happening daily everywhere and you will just have to live with itwell yea the wind and water does care about invisible linesya don t say eyes roll so hard i m now blindif only people cared this much about fracking plumesdon t worry i m sure the ohio gop will fix itand there was just a metal plant explosion in ohio as wellwhat worries me too is what is in the air after they burned the chemicals especially since wind currents go north i m in upstate ny and am wanting to know if anything was effected since so many things are being covered up by the company onlinewhoa who would have thunk itwait you mean their monumental fuckup did even respect city or stat linesbut the water is fineit should norfolk southern is a gigantic company on its own and that s not including every other train line that is currently operating under the same rules whether they admit to it or notnot that i want more peoples lives at risk but maybe this will get the necessary reaction from the local govtdeletedepa is a joke it s a patronizing pat on the head that doesn t actually do much to help people when help is clearly needed like in this situationdoes fears really belong to the topic namenobody gives a shit about these people trump clowns himself by buying mcdonald and saying he helping when quite possibly it was his deregulation that enabled this whole mess and biden nor any other politician in office seems to care to do anything fuck this timelinefear not actual measured danger fear probably stoked by the media and political opportunistsoh my god its going to kill us all this is the single greatest disaster in all of american historythought that was about the asian country palestine for a momentis this going to affect places like hocking hills i have plans for summeri hope that the residents do pay attention to tucker carlson who wants to politicize the derailment to criticize biden he actually said something like east palestine is mostly white and so biden will ignore or forget them that is so sadnani like how the uk media outlet does this investigative reportingone reported accident every two days nothing to say about bribing

guardian analysis of data collected by the environmental protection agency epa and by groups that track chemical accidents in the us shows that accidental releases be they through train derailments truck crashes pipeline ruptures or industrial plant leaks and spills are happening consistently across the country by one estimate these incidents are occurring on average every two days in the first seven weeks of 2023 alone there were more than 30 incidents recorded by the coalition to prevent chemical disasters roughly one every day and a half last year the coalition recorded 188 up from 177 in 2021 the group has tallied more than 470 incidents since it started counting in april 2020 the epa itself says that by several measurements accidents at facilities are becoming worse evacuations sheltering and the average annual rate of people seeking medical treatment stemming from chemical accidents are on the rise total annual costs are approximately 477m including costs related to injuries and deaths in august the epa proposed several changes to the risk management program rmp regulations that apply to plants dealing with hazardous chemicals the rule changes reflect the recognition by epa that many chemical facilities are located in areas that are vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis including power outages flooding hurricanes and other weather events the proposed changes include enhanced emergency preparedness increased public access to information about hazardous chemicals risks communities face and new accident prevention requirements to surprise the industries involved in the pollution risks and the chamber of commerce got to keep the wealthy corporations happy at all costs all demand no increased protection is required the us chamber of commerce has pushed back on stronger regulations arguing that most facilities operate safely accidents are declining and that the facilities impacted by any rule changes are supplying essential products and services that help drive our economy and provide jobs in our communities other opponents to strengthening safety rules include the american chemistry council american forest paper association american fuel petrochemical manufacturers and the american petroleum institute the changes are unnecessary and will not improve safety according to the american chemistry councilall thanks to corporate greedhave the media helped cover it up for decades by not reporting on it yupa politician showing up to every chemical accident is like showing up to every mass shooting it better to work on legislation and executive actions than a bunch of photo opsi never heard of anything more environmentally sustainable than poisoning a chunk of the surface every two dayswait until people find out about how everyday items have been leaching toxic into our food and water for decadeschemical accident needs to step up its game mass shooting is pulling waaay aheadif that true then where the hell are all my new uscsb videoslobbying is effectiveguns those are rookie numbers got ta pump those upin my mind the ideal government for our time is one that s small in the average person s life but massive to corporationsare they really accidents or is it just more along of the lines of fuck it regulations are for suckers and even if we caught it still more profitable than doing things by the bookoh shit republicans apparently regulations do matterif you do hate the us you not an american only dumb people with low standards can look the other wayis this the simpson s movieit would be intersting to analyze the actual chemicals involved to determine the reasons for those chemicals existing are they actually necessary to the production of whatever product they are destined for or are they as i suspect a more harmful but also more profitable workaround for a more costly original process like the trans fat problem trans fats are better than natural fats they are cheaper so they were used all over the place and ended up causing a bunch of unintended health effects how many of these traincars full of danger would need to be there in the first place if corners were being cut in other industriesbut according to republicans it regulation that the problemthis is what you get when you privatize the profit and socialize the expenses of doing business not only is there no incentive for these companies to protect the environment or their workers but there is a profit to be made off of endangering bothbecause corporations can do whatever the fuck they want hereso it happens a little less than half as often as mass shootings it s wild that there are people here that still think america is the greatest countryrepublicans remind me of the russians and chernobyl same attitude leading to the same result the people on the ground end up paying with their lives and healthonly a good country with chemical accidents can stop a bad country with chemical accidentsmeanwhile we all supposed to recycle get evs car pool take public transportation not use products with cfcs and not dump toxic shit in the sink storm drain but large corporations do whatever the fuck they want with impunity we fuckedthat actually a lot lower than i expected for a country with over 300 million peopleapparently we been to distracted by school shootings to noticemeanwhile mass shootings those are rookie numbersanyone remember how people said the accident at bhopal could happen herewe are only 3 years into this decade smhone disaster every two days but what they don t say is that each off day there s a mass shooting so we re still balancing things out1970 infrastructure continuing to failgot to knock down them real estate prices and force people to move so land can be bought up for fire sale pricesso republicans are running with that defund the police mantra democrats will no doubt be blamed like alwaysin florida there are water buffalo tanks full of unknown chemicals being pulled behind pickup trucks on open trailers no placards of any kind sometimes it an exterminator sometimes it just a guy with a vat of chemicals and there are no regulations whatsoever the police do give a shit but who knows what those chemicals are what happens if they spill where is the sds do the people transporting them actually have them available what about a bill of ladingwho do these chemical spills think they are mass shootingsmy favorite part about capitalism i sure hope those quintillipnaores get their extra burger bucks yummyso that s why we re like thisthose are rookie numbers but i know our government is hard at work on bringing them up so im not worriedsystematic thinning of the herdsit s like a really bad infomercialyou can smell the freedom of deregulationwell on track to catch up with school shootingsthat does even include those punks spraying diesel fuel all over their truck for likes on tik tokseems pretty normal in a place that often views any sort of protection from corporate abuse as communismaverage citizens wtf moments increase to 100 per dayand two mass shootings every single dayso they are giving mass shootings a run for their moneywait until you find out about shootingsthis is the regulation the dems want and gop destroys we need safety measures and preventative measures in place and if a company can t overcome these basic fundamental parts than it should not operate simplerecord profits thoughthat walks over barrel of degreaser into grass walks awayi not sure what to make of this super wide ranging dataset vs any historical trend this is also an estimate of kind of loose data nothing is revealed so i feel a need to complain a bit a guardian analysis of data collected by the environmental protection agency epa and by groups that track chemical accidents in the us shows that accidental releases be they through train derailments truck crashes pipeline ruptures or industrial plant leaks and spills are happening consistently across the country by one estimate these incidents are occurring on average every two days the incidents logged by the coalition range widely in severity but each involves the accidental release of chemicals deemed to pose potential threats to human and environmental healthi wish biden would make some dramatic televised speech about what trump did and how dangerous it is but he won tmy wife does environment law she said it s just amazing how much cover up has gone on and how little the us government does to stop it i ve tried to cut out some forever chemicals and she always says it doesn t even matter cause they are in so much stuff we eat it s really dishearteningand we wonder why we ve all got cancerhere s a wild idea all chemical companies pay a separate tax to cover the cost of universal healthcare in the us on top of their insurance covering even a single drop spilled and payouts to the communities and wildlife impactedthank you republicans and deregulationjust imagine if it were revealed that there were people murdered with guns every two daysthat actually seems remarkably low for a country of 350 million people i imagine most accidents go unreportedso since i have a decent level of training with hazardous chemicals us i wondering what constitutes and is logged as an accident say that i spill a 55 gal drum of phosphoric acid within the plant it cleaned up and none gets to a drain or what if it does what if it only a gallon of chlorine no where in the article or on the coalition to prevent chemical disaster a complete impartial source website does it list criteria i do support environmental destruction or work for a chemical manufacturer but i do think a little bit of perspective needs to be applied when talking about these topicsjust remove the regulations altogether the invisible hand of the freemarket will fix it all up right after jerking off the corporate shareholdersi think we need to frame this in units an everyday american will understand this is 1 chemical accident for every 2 mass shootingstrump did this just rememberawesome maybe they will beat out the news coverage of mass shootings soon i getting

https praising himself on reddit and other sites using anonymous handles if you see any wow this scott adams guy is smart and his opinions are really well thought out type comments in here good chance it is himthe quote this is the first political poll that ever changed my activities i do know that that ever happened before you normally you see a poll you just look at it you go ah whatever yeah oh this is interesting what other people think but as of today i going to read identify as white as i do want to be a member of a hate group i accidentally joined the hate group so if you nearly half of all blacks are not okay with white people according to this poll not according to me according to this poll that a hate group that a hate group and i do want to have anything to do with them and i would say you know based on the current way things are going the best advice i would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people just get the f ck away wherever you have to go just get away cuz there no fixing this this ca be fixed all right this ca be fixed you just have to escape so that what i did i went to a neighborhood where you know i have a very low black population cuz unfortunately you know there a high correlation between the density this is going to don lemon by the way so here i just quoting don lemon when he notes that when he lived in a mostly black neighborhood there were a bunch of problems that he did see in white neighborhoods so even don lemon sees a big difference in your own quality of living based on where you live and who there so i think it makes no sense whatsoever as a white citizen of america to try to help black citizens anymore it does make sense it is no longer a rational impulse and so i going to i going to back off from being helpful to black america because it does seem like it pays off like i been doing it all my life and the only outcome is i get called a racist that the only outcome it makes no sense to help black americans if you white it over do even think it worth trying totally not trying now we should be friendly like i not saying start a war you know do anything bad nothing like that i just saying get away just get awaythe dilbert creator has seemingly embraced more radical positions since first comparing former president donald trump to jesus in late 2015 since then he s openly courted controversy while dipping his toes into culture war battles outside of peddling debunked cures adams also ludicrously predicted that if joe biden won the presidential election there was a good chance republicans would be hunted down and dead within a year how did i miss the signs holy helljim davis scott garfield creator jim davis response to being asked about the will smith slap i do really keep up with the oscars i mainly just make comic stripshe been insane for decades why is it just now that they noticed almost 20 years ago i read an essay by him that was a bunch of ridiculous nonsense based on an incorrect assumption a few days later he posted again claiming that the original essay was a test to see which of his readers was paying attention or some shit he all of the worst kinds of internet asshole put togetherhe also recently got divorced which seemingly pushed him from being covertly racist to loud and proud racist shades of aubrey huff s twitter accounti use to like his work then he supported the guy who literally was the love child of the and moron ceo and went all it like did you actually understand your own comicever since his wife left him he s been on the brink of snapping i don t know if it s boredom or what but he is thriving from all this attention it s quite oddthis fuckhead used to rant about how it would be open season on conservatives if biden were elected that they would be hunted down what happened to that you dumbfuckgood the guy has gone full racist nutjob at this pointthe rationalwiki article on him lists a whole bunch of dumb racist misogynist stuff that he been saying for a while httpsi used to be a huge dilbert fan i even bought scott adams book where he talked about how his magical thinking made him successful that was the beginning of the end the way he bloviated about how much smarter and better than most people he was i tapped out when he went full mysoginist in 2011 fortunately dilbert had already been garfield or cathy levels of funny for years by that point with nothing but rehashed punchlines and tropes i was putting books together to give to charity the last time i moved downsized my whole scott adams collection and then realized this stuff belongs in the dumpster not someone else hands the only thing that surprises me about all of this was that there were still papers carrying dilbert he went full whackadoo years agogot a lot less funny once i realized adams has been advocating corporatocracy vs mocking it dogbert is the true expression of adams beliefs not satiricali wonder when we ll start seeing dilbert on the stupid flagsfinally he s been crazy for several years he thrives on the attentionalways makes me wonder about people i liked his early work a lot was getting papers anymore and so kind of drifted away and then crazy behavior came out with early social media and it was wtf did a pod person get him it was bad enough then and so much worse how puzzles me how someone can create human and insightful material without seeming to personally understand it you think dickens would be a marvelous person due to his writings and he was a total bastard how can you write like you get it but not in your life people are strangeplease just rerun calvin and hobbes in his placedilbert isn t funny when you realize the pointy haired boss is intended as the protagonistthe big irony for me is that i worked in exactly the same kind of environment his strip was supposed to parody the tech world is a smorgasbord of diversity i never had a tech job without having a broad mix of races cultures and lifestyles edit i 53 you pups yes the 90s is when i was laboring in and it not too far off from adams time in the office workforce so contemporary to my time what did silicon valley get after i leftshame i used to like dilbertfor me watching scott adams speak with conviction against african americans like that was surreal this was some subtle mention or a sound bite pulled out of context that mf was straight up talking about how black people were a group that white people needed to the hell away fromgood fuck scott adamsit like this dude signed a deal with the devil where his humanity left him slowly over the years through his pen where every time he drew a character like dilbert alice and wally they stole his soul bit by bitthere will be no reflection adams will see himself forever as a victimi think there is an interesting book waiting to be written about scott adams in the heyday of the tech boom dilbert was brilliantly insightful and almost prescient somehow adams became a trumper and lost his perspective and sense of humor i think he started off fearing higher taxes but kept getting deeper into conspiracy theorieshe s not crazy he s racist blaming this on mental health excuses his behavior he s not nuts he s a bigotconsidering the guy has apparently been an openly racist right wing nut job for a long time it s sadly way overdue and this is from someone who thought the cartoon was fun in the late as a kidwhat are the odds this dude ends up at a gop campaign rallyit s great that idiots keep outing themselveshahaha the guy blocked everyone on twitter that criticized him until he had a sycophantic cult that tolerated his racism and now he suffers from the cult he createdit has spawned a media empire featuring dozens of books a video game an animated television series and thousands of coffee cups and related merchandise i can imagine few things less fun than a dilbert video game and i was once left in dumbfounded awe by ponghere we go fox news is going to be going on about dilbert being cancelled top priorities for fox news green m ms mr potato head seuss dilbert cartoon literally the mentality of childreni m honestly surprised that comic was still around it was never entertaining in the leasti remember when he was on sam harris waking up podcast he kept talking about how it may appear that trump is an idiot that does things seemingly at random but it s all part of a plan and he s a master negotiator you just have to wait and see how it all comes together turns out trump was just an idiot that did random things sam was so frustrated trying to have a conversation with him and i was frustrated as a listenerlol this cartoon i made came true after all these years https it rather wonderfully got me blocked by him so i know he s seen it and it made his life that slightly bit worse the dilbert creator has a weird habit of taking naked selfies in front of mirrors as replies to arguments he has online httpshe will just show up on some outlet crying about cancel culture but it really still amazes me that people have these viewsi do know what gradient of too online i am that i was already keenly aware of what kind of fantastic conservative twitter clownsock scott adams is but had absolutely no idea he was still making dilbert strips i thought he was like james woods and whatever career he once had he since abandoned to be a weird shithead on the internetnanthe john catanzara referenced in this article who is president of lodge 7 of the fraternal order of police in chicago is an interesting person to look into he a big guy and met his wife while she was an underage student at the school he was working at as a school resource officer he widely recognized as the biggest villain in the cityin case anyone was wondering john catanzara has more allegations of policing violations than 96 of the chicago force httpschicago politics at its bestcops not only disclosing but mailing out an announcement

george floyd riots of 2020 we were on our boat at the dock we had been out for a sail and we re going to have some food and wine and overnight on the boat to observe the curfew the news was reporting the city was in chaos lightfoot was requesting help from the governor so you would think every on duty cop would be mobilize to guard people and property but not in chicago we watched as a large group of both and cops partied away at a boat a few slips over the bike mounted cops were in uniform and had their bikes parked on the dock all the while the city was in crisis chicago pd is an embarrassmentcops are top innovators in being pathetic shit headsin a statement to wttw news a spokesperson for the perez campaign said it is critical that voters have access to complete and accurate information about their candidates before making decisions that impact their community perez has yet to report the contribution from the police union tied to the flyer to his campaign committee state law requires candidates to report contributions of or more from a single source within two business days of receipt if it is 30 days or fewer before an election it unfortunate the article does say when the donation was made but the implication is that it was in the last few weeks if so hopefully voters will get this critical information about perez that his campaign has violated state campaign finance laws and hopefully the local da or state ag or whatever authority is responsible for enforcing illinois campaign laws will promptly file charges against perez and whomever in his campaign is responsible for filing financial disclosure reports regardless of who wins the election it just unfortunate they ca send a few members of the chicago fraternal order of police to prison as welli

chicago or even illinois but if the s departments in my area backed a candidate my knee jerk response would be to avoid and not vote for that candidatemy cousin was arrested when he was a teenager and later became a copjulian jumping perez awesomei dont like this but i m also not sure it s news worthy if it was an average middle class person or poor person no one would be concerned that their criminal record was following them it s pretty common to hear about people missing out on job opportunities or even being barred from renting certain apartments because of decades old criminal charges hell some professions completely bar people from licensure for eternity for certain misdemeanor charges until that s addressed i m hard pressed to feel for a politician who s living under the same conditions as everyone else perhaps the system should address the real problemi think its about time we start calling all the super heroes to help us in this universenanstudents ca get mad when she won unopposed lol she part of the student body too rightso she enters a popularity contest runs unopposed and now people are bothered because she won by default this is nonsense it not worth the backlash it the standard pettiness that comes with a popularity contestshe said roles like the royal court positions at hbcus are crucial in representing students who have been historically underserved at predominantly white institutions hahahaha i guess guatemalan people are counted as being historically underservedshe ran un opposed she won previous years as well there is no actual controversy here people just want to create problems where there are noneany one of any race has the capacity to be bigoted and isolationistsi attended an hbcu and feel that she should have to renounce her crownno outrage it clickbait out of fewif they have you fighting over race you will be too preoccupied to fight over class and the powers that be can continue to be the powers that bei never considered stepping down perez told nbc news she applied for the role knowing she might face some backlash but ran unopposed and was officially crowned in octoberwe going to call the reaction racist it issounds like a pretty racist thing to saysad story bc hbcu s were historically radical in how accepting they are of any students in direct contrast to segregated colleges they famously accepted german jews before and during wwii into their faculty this kind of hatred directed at a latina betrays that legacyamerican universities are so weird in europe you go to class in some anonymous building finish class go home and do your stuffcool good for her hope she uses it to her advantagekelaina slaughter 20 a junior majoring in english at the university of louisville in kentucky first learned about the controversy surrounding perez from a different tiktok video slaughter explained why she thinks a role like miss coppin state university should go to a black person she said roles like the royal court positions at hbcus are crucial in representing students who have been historically underserved at predominantly white institutions historically underserved at white institutions yes like latina womenthe article specifically states she s black and mexican so what s the problem biracial white and black has been accepted and you don t see an outcrythe woman s name george santosthere s black people in the latin community it s this whole concept of race created by colonial societywhen you see stupid things like this or almost anything in the internet remember that this is internet majority of people don t think like this out side of the internet even on internet majority will say it s stupid it s just vocal minoritybut ran unopposed then why are people bitching oh right it because the people bitching have nothing better to do they did even go to the school so it does even affect themthis is the same type of manufactured outrage bait as any post on the tumblr in action sub this just has a fancier presentation for ithow do americans still have segregated schoolsall latinas are queens todozens of posts shut the fuck upmany people seem to enjoy racism i find it all very exhausting to imagine being so full of hate all of the timeonce again white people getting upset for another racelarry elder will tell you blacks are more racist than whites personally i have no opinion i wish to share on this matter edit source is a book he wrote called ten things you ca say in america 2nd edit for those who do know larry is a black dudeorganizations with racist titles or names should be prohibiteddeletedreminds me of when obama got elected people were like hey not like that when they let black people vote and run for office they didn t expect them to actually win this kid was admitted to the school and allowed to run so it s all fair gameracism about racist innuendos and racial feelings sells news bytes also i do not like or admire bigotry or stupidity in any being when that same level of bigotry is used as is almost equally as idiotocshe ran unopposed if people want to bitch why do they yell at all those that did runremovedlmao the ones crying racists are just another racistsnanjust had a friend who needed ivs because he couldn t keep water down for 4 days he said he felt like he could have died from it lost 10 lbs and said it was the worst stomach bug he s ever had dude is a health nut to boot doesn t drink or smoke and exercises dailyworst night of my life from a stomach bug going around here in canada highly contagious too insane vomiting fever diarrhea stomach achewtf is a public health concern article paywalledmy takeaway from the headline and picture beware of hotdogsthe centers for disease control and prevention is warning clinicians and public health departments about a sharp rise in serious gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to common antibiotics in a health advisory issued friday the cdc said the agency has been monitoring an increase in people infected with strains of shigella bacteria that are highly resistant to available drugs shigella infections known as shigellosis usually cause diarrhea that can be prolonged and bloody as well as fever and abdominal cramps in the past shigellosis has predominantly affected children under 4 but cdc said it has seen a recent increase in infections in adults especially men who have sex with men international travelers people living with hiv and people experiencing homelessness most people recover without treatment with antibiotics but people who have weakened immune systems including those with hiv or who are receiving chemotherapy can get a more serious illness severe shigellosis can spread into the blood which can be shigella infections are challenging to treat and easily transmissible especially among vulnerable populations said naeemah logan a cdc medical officer in an email these superbug infections are a serious public health threat and we want to ensure that providers are aware of the increasing potential for antibiotics to the agency has scheduled a call next week to brief clinicians about the rise in cases and how to manage them shigella cause an estimated infections in the united states each year in 2022 about 5 percent of shigella infections reported to the cdc were caused by strains compared with none in 2015 of 237 patients with resistant infections that were reported during this period more than 90 percent of them happened during the pandemic between 2020 and 2022 according to the cdc resistant infections have been reported in 29 states with the largest numbers in california 76 colorado 36 and massachusetts 34 according to cdc data these strains are resistant to five commonly recommended antibiotics including azithromycin ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone last year the cdc said the pandemic caused a surge in overall superbug infections and deaths in hospitals reversing years of progress public health efforts had driven down resistant infections in hospitals by nearly 30 percent between 2012 and 2017 but in 2020 the pandemic pushed hospitals health departments and communities to near breaking points sicker patients needed more frequent and longer use of medical devices such as catheters and ventilators that break the body s natural protective barrier the skin and so increase infection risk in addition clinicians unfamiliar with the coronavirus at first relied heavily on antibiotics to treat patients but those lifesaving drugs work against bacteria not against viruses the unusually high levels of antibiotic use probably allowed drug resistance to develop and spread shigella bacteria spread rapidly and easily through direct contact including sexual contact they also spread indirectly through contaminated food water and other routes it takes just a small number of bacteria to make someone sick and infected people can spread the germs to others for several weeks after their diarrhea ends the cdc said it does not currently have recommendations for the best way to treat highly resistant shigella infections in recent months global cases of shigellosis have been on the rise in january 2022 the united kingdom reported an increase in cases of extremely infections mainly in men who have sex with men as of a dozen countries including the united states have reported more than 250 shigella infections since september 2022 in people who went to cape verde in west africa according to the european centre for disease control and prevention shigellosis symptoms usually start one to two days after infection and last seven days in some cases bowel habits don t return to normal for several monthsbut cdc said it has seen a recent increase in infections in adults especially men who have sex with men international travelers people living with hiv and people experiencing homelessness given that it an intestinal infection i assume this means one vector of transmission is from unprotected anal sex one more reason to wear condoms it sounds likemy cousin 7 month old has this right now and it been awful he been

flatlanderpeople might kind of make fun of this but the only earthquakes i experienced in california were around this magnitude and its scary as hell when you wake up and your bed is shakingi didn t realize the uk got earthquakes must have been scary for those who experienced iti d be pretty freaked out too after seeing the destruction in turkey and syria especially since i ve never really felt an earthquakewe rarely get these in the uk the earth is pissedis the earth trying to shake us offhey fellow californians can we not embarrass ourselves a natural disaster is scary at any magnitude if its not expected or rare and built for in the area we freak out and crash into each other at any sign of weather hereas opposed to only part of the bedhow close is the nearest fracking operationis it just me or uk is getting more and more earthquake lately or maybe i haven t been quite aware and that there s always been this much earthquake in ukin an area that does have any earthquake codes for their buildings i felt the 2011 east coast earthquake and i lived 180 miles from the epicenter it was kinda scary i saw half my kitchen floor raise up because it was flexing i guessing it felt like i was on a boatnot trying to downplay it or anything but myself and most people in california literally do feel 3s let alone having it shake your bed maybe if you near the epicenteri took one look at this post and immediately knew it would be filled with americans i live in cardiff and felt it it lasted approximately 1 secondyou say californianif the bed a rockin do come a knockinmy earthquake app doesn t even notify me for ai have had bigger farts than ai do think i even notice a having grown up in southern california i remember being in the quakewould feel like a heavy truck passing bylol in cali a 4 might make your monitor shake depending on how your place is built outside you feel nothing granted most buildings that are built in the 90s i want to say were made up to codei do get up for anything less than 6 ツprobably the most action that person had in bed for a long timea can barely wake me up been thru so many is like me rolling into bedsomeone needs to get laid more oftenwonder did the sheep think it was good sex tooliving in california unless it more than a it does really bother memeanwhile as someone that lives in memphis tn we are way overdue for one several decades in fact or if you listen to others well over a century but this is all a moot point if somehow the fault has shutdown or is that even possiblei once woke up because there was a massive bang outside but i never found out what it was is that what like to wake up to an earthquakewell it would be kind of weird if only part of the bed shook i think that would freak me out a bitwhen asked for comment his wife said bahnanrivera had no evidence of purchasing the ticket and ultimately no theft report was written up just a common scammer trying to make a buckthat reggie stole my winning ticket toorather incredibly pointless when the store camera footage will have already shown the realityjose rivera claims that he purchased the ticket from joe s service center on or around 7 2022 and that it was stolen from him by a man he knows only as rivera alleges that he tried to get the ticket back from reggie after the winning number was announced on 8 2022 but that reggie refused to do so and tried to blackmail rivera into splitting the winnings by threatening to destroy the ticket eh sounds like a pretty unlikely storywho goes about stealing lottery tickets as if they know it s the winning ticketwhy do they release the name of the winners now every schmuck would be coming after him with frivolous lawsuitslol it not as if they do do a little verification to be sure any yahoo can make a false claim as the courts have decided many times regarding one dt a 2 billion claim probably gets a little extra scrutinyrivera filed a lawsuit against castro reggie and the california lottery on 22 in los angeles county superior court asking the court to declare him as the rightful owner of the lottery ticket and the prize money rivera alleges that he tried to get the ticket back from reggie after the winning number was announced on 8 2022 but that reggie refused to do so and tried to blackmail rivera into splitting the winnings by threatening to destroy the ticket depending how long ago it was when he purchased the ticket there might be a slim chance the shop has a recording of the purchaseok does the place have security cameras lottery system should have the time recorded of when ticket was sold just look at which person was at the counter at that time not to mentioned as printed on the tickets sign them when you buy them without a signature they are considered property of who ever has them in handwait no that was my ticketi had an acquaintance win a few million in canada he was grilled for almost 2 hours before he was given the confirming where he bought the ticket checked the card he used to pay did a background check to see if he was related to any lotto employees etc if you a ticket they will figure it out pretty quickly if the ticket wasn t paid for in cash you get nothing without providing the card used there are cameras everywhere now as welltoo many people try and basically commit fraud as soon as they win divorce bankruptcy whatever where they try and basically do admit to winning the lottery as they settle upi had a half of a breakfast burrito in my fridge and now its gone fucking reggiewhoever s name is on the back is the owner and winner read your lottery ticketsi mean it s a 2 billion lottery ticket the largest in history i d be half tempted to try and file a lawsuit saying it was mine and i don t even live in california lmao of course someone will come out of the woodwork saying it s rightfully theirs congrats to the winner t imagine the feelinghow did edwin castro find out that jose rivera had the winning ticket did jose go around telling everyone that he had the winning ticket before he cashed it if i had the winning ticket i would take a picture and send a date delayed email to my sisters i know how to do that with gmail unlike many redditors i would cash it as fast as possiblethere was a big mega millions winner by me once and they said which gas station it was sold at the very next day some woman is out there on the news claiming she bought the ticket at that gas station but she lost it there before she left sure jan for a week people crawled all over that gas station looking for it then the actual winner claimed the prize this crazy liar tried to create a narrative so when the actual winner came forward she could claim it was her missing ticket it didn t work but it was funny seeing all those people there looking in bushes in trash cans1 reason to alway keep your receiptdeletedan actual use case for nftsi lost a lottery ticket here in australia whilst walking from the train station a week later a neighbout told me they won 1 million i joled with him if he found the ticket it was mine he laughed and would not answer my bad luck if he did find my ticket and won he never stole itanother option is buying tickets online many states offer that and eliminates much of the issues with physical tickets that are essentially bearer documents in pennsylvania to buy lottery one needs to register an account and all purchases are in the name of the account holder much better and safer than physical tickets seems eventually lotteries will more aggressively tout safety as another reason to buy big jackpot games plus lotteries benefit too by not having to pay out sales commissions to retailers hopefully the ca lottery handles this promptly because there are some lottery players who avoid buying powerball mega million tickets when jackpots get unusually high for just this reasoni ca believe he stole my lottery ticketmaybe he should waited for the thief to turn in ticketnanoh fun according to

when he saw us cross he crossed as well the girls freaked out we took some pictures where we were and then we were going to abandon the idea of walking out to the end but he got distracted by some other passersby and we quickly got past him but he still managed to tell us that he wanted to munch on our cookies strength in numbers then last week one of our athletes found this article and sent it

instead of beer he s moved on to cookiesits when i think about my little girl seeing him and getting really excited and us considering to approach that sickens me you just do expect someone in a kids character costume in broad daylight to be sus it definitely helped me see every single person as a threat which is sad it should be this way but the world we live in especially currently is vile and in complete disrepairso what has he actuallly done that warrants the term terrorizing from the article he dresses up in a costume and wants to get a tip for his picture just like a hundreds of other street performers i tourist areas and he gets mad if you don t tip just like the other tourist workers what s the problem that the article isn t reporting on edit good ole reddit someone does know

some of need some context to suit your memory loss on 4 december 2021 president recep tayyip erdoğan issued a presidential circular calling for exports to be labelled made in türkiye the circular also said that in relation to other governmental communications necessary sensitivity will be shown on the use of the phrase instead of phrases such asnanto be clear 17 of the g20 seem okay with calling the war a war russia china and india are the holdoutsrussia and china disagreed with the two paragraphs on the war that had been cleared by all participants in november we jointly condemn the russian attack on ukraine here there was very great common ground however with the exception of the very ambivalent chinese german finance minister christian lindner told reporters after the statement s release no surprise heredoes it matter what does that achieve aside from wasting their own timesounds like we need to just have a g17 meeting and get things done they should have prepped for this just tac it on to the end of the g20 meeting let the russian chinese and indian delegations out the doors shuts the doors the g17 meeting is now in session we call for a vote to finalize discussions from the g20 meetingindia is too busy enjoying that cheap russian oilindia showing it true snake colorsviolence is the love language of corruptiontime to expel russia and sanction chinaindia seems persistently determined to undermine its own future for short term gains aligning with china and russia is a really good way to lose territory to china which does share a border with india and would love to push it a bit further outward when that time comes do they think they ll find western allies willing to help themshithole countries sticking togethershould have set the bar to needing only an 80 agreement to protect against rogue nations in the g20three shit fuck stupid piss worthless countries held out you mean fix your daft fucking titleno one wants endless wars no one wants carbon tax poor genocide no one wants to be under constant surveillance anyone who agrees with me has been deemed an enemy by the corporate feudal system we were born intonanmy wife works with students that have behavioral problems and has been attacked multiple times only to have the administrators say oh no need to report it here s the real breakdown administration is terrified of being sued by students once the teachers start suing then things will change action is only taken when there is fear involvedthe video captures the teen kicking the worker twice while she was on the ground he then hits her more than a dozen times on her body and head video shows after the attack the arrest report says the teen spat in the direction of the injured worker and said that when he returns he is going to kill her over a fucking switchhere the video of the attack https obvious warning due to graphic naturei read that she was a teacher but a teacher aid otherwise known as a paraprofessional paraprofessionals tend to work exclusively in special education to support students with special needs it does surprise me this has happened to a para i am one myself and i have the scars to prove it i have been bitten punched attacked spit at and have kids expose themselves before attacking me i also had kids take off their pull ups to throw at my head and urinate or defecate on the floor before kicking it towards me there is a distinct lack of respect that school officials have towards paras and it sadly does surprise me in the least the man in the video was slow to respond or helpthis kid needs to be in a home or jail he s a danger to societyall of the teachers around him possibly afraid to physically confront him because of the repercussions to their careers this video was all over reddit i hope the teacher is okay and people are raising money for her recoveryfor anyone interested here is a post containing a not quite safe for work video of the beating the teacher received it is brutal httpsthe attack was much more brutal than what the headline suggests a florida pummeled a female school employee leaving her unconscious after she confiscated his nintendo switch according to police and video surveillance of the attack the student is and weighs 270 pounds officials said video from the incident provided by the sheriff shows the student who is not being identified because he is a minor rushing toward the worker and pushing her to the ground she goes limp and the arrest report said she appeared to lose consciousness the video captures the teen kicking the worker twice while she was on the ground he then hits her more than a dozen times on her body and head video shows i hope he tried as an adultthe boy s parents could not immediately be reached for comment friday i shockeddoes anyone know how the woman is doing because she must have some frickin serious injuriesterrible story these teachers deserve so much better manjesus christ it really looked like he was trying to kill her over a damn nintendo switch smhpoor lady hope she is ok but yea most schools don t care about teachers i m fortunate enough to where my school takes the burden off of us and they will actually discipline students and not make us do the heavy lifting when contacting parents and arranging meetings with the parents over the kids behavior we have enough support staff and sped specialist who handle that for us despite my school having overwhelmingly lower income single parent demographics and a large amount of refugees we have a good staff to help out despite being in a rough area they will come into the rooms and work independently with students who have issues you just send them modified work and that s that some districts the teachers themselves have to handle these situations thus increasing the workload when i was a student teacher at different district more affluent district there was a pretty year old english teacher fresh out of university she had a student with behavioral issues who sent her a dick pic she filed a report and the student got suspended for like 3 days the parents come back threatening to sue the school because their child had behavioral issues i forgot exactly what and how they are discriminating her son with mental illness who also happened to be black in a largely school so they played that up as well so all the teachers had to take some sensitivity training seminar about the importance of tolerance and patience the student stayed at school but was moved to a different class that teacher ended up quitting after her 1st yearif you see the video knocked unconsciouse is a hell of a understatement she was beaten unconscious by a blow to the head and savagely hit and kicked by a student twice her size and her colleagues just stood by and watched for the first 10 secondsthe crazy bit is when i saw this on twitter there were loads of tweets with hundreds of likes saying stupid shit like well don t take someone s things then humanity is doomedafter the attack the arrest report says the teen spat in the direction of the injured worker and said that when he returns he is going to kill her your move super intendant what are you going to do nowi seriously hope she s that fucking kid walloped the shit outta heri hope that poor woman doesn t have a load of permanent brain trauma from that savage psychothat some brutal head trauma this will likely affect her the rest of her life not to mention ptsdthis video is horrible horrible the kid is clearly special needs and everything about this makes me livid this teacher probably makes absolute shit pay i m betting that tank of a kid has probably been a problem before and for sure had no business being in a classroom with a smaller female teacher as someone who works in mental health the complete lack of priority and funding for those vulnerable populations and the caregivers and teachers is a fucking travestythat kid could killed that ladyknocked unconscious is being a bit too politeno mention of how the victim is doingknocked unconscious it was so much more than that after being knocked unconscious teacher was brutally beaten by raged student 3x her sizeinclusive education doesn t work we tried it it was supposed to raise the lowest in the class up it doesn t it drags everyone down in reality there is usually one teacher most teachers are female and maybe some teaching assistants i had none when i taught hs how is one person supposed to control and teach effectively if there are kids like this in the class we need more and effective special education units catching a wider number of special needs kids we need more and more effective mental health in patient units good teachers are leaving the profession because of issues like thisneed to bring back asylums i dont even care if he didnt know what he was doing his actions were brutal and should not be tolerated in our society so he should be removed and prevented from participating in itam i going to jail because i have more important thing to boy if he wasn t going to jail he would already be back in the lab creating the cure for cancer yes i m aware he s special needsi so happy that the jrotc instructor did hurry or anythingthat was attempted murder saying knocked unconscious is less than half of what happenedthrow away the fucking key special ed or not that attack was fucking brutal i d be surprised if she returned after that teaching seems like a very high reward career path i genuinely can t see why people would choose it anymoreshe didn t die but that many brutal blows to the head i feel like there s no way this woman isn t permanently injured or disabled in some way truly horrifyingthose female staff showed more courage than that marinei m surprised at the lack of effort by other staff and the cop that slowly walks towards the situationafter watching that video he needs to be tried as an adult simply ca have this person on the streets and you ca tell me that a couple months of development would make a difference dude is 6 6 270 lbs and did that to his female teacher if he do it to her he do it to anyoneshe prob only makes like 20k too so the medical bills should be no problemand people wonder why nobody wants to work anywhere near a school parents whinge and helicopter or they dont give a flying fuck the administration thinks you are stupid and needs micromanagement the students barely respect you and you barely get funding for textbooks and materials now add on you ca a student without getting your shit kicked inpassive voice used oddly in headlinefta the student is and weighs 270 pounds officials i hope he gets charged as an adultwhat can you do to help someone like this can therapy or anything foster empathy in a person who is 17 and has none a person who values another human less than they value a toynever thought i d say this but get your kids out of public schoolhe tried to murder that women and would have if not for the employees who were able step in to stop the bludgeoning this kid needs serious psychiatric care edit wordsi m flat sick of those who defend the actions of people who damn well know better just because they re a couple years under our arbitrary age of majority he s 17 not 7 he needs to be treated like the dangerous physical adult he iswe need to separate students that want to learn and are gifted from these children with violent tendencies and or other behavior problemsat my wife school kids get away with hitting teachers if they have ieps and it determined that the student is causing the behavior absolutely mental that a kid can be a violent little undisciplined shit get an iep for it and act aggressively without consequence and teachers just have to put up with it for under 50k a yearthe video in the fightporn sub straight out attempted murder is what it was people were reallllly slow giving a shit and helping stop the onslaught as welland they wonder why there is a teacherthis headline is the understatement of the century this beating was brutal and i hope they lock him away foreverthe marine in the video just strolling up to the attack like he couldn t care less ab the student attacking the teacher is actually crazyare we going to lock this thread too just curiousi find it hard to believe he does have a violent history the school has failed to protect the staff and students he obviously needs help in a different schools like to collect the extra funds they get for at risk children then when they age out it straight to prison because our system is flawedthe term is called expulsion not suspension and charge this kid for assaulting the teacher over a device being taken away schools have no backbone towards awful behaviour the parents also suck in doing nothing about this unless the parents are the cause of such horrible behaviour obviously fuck them then note mental illness if in situations like this needs to stop being used as a fucking excuse for either kids or teens or even adults bad behaviour regardless if they normal or disabledspecial needs is not an excuse for almost killing someone over a video game being taken awayhe s lenny and we re all the mousethe kid is a menace look him upholy shit i just saw the video lock that scumbag in a psych ward and throw away the keyteachers across america should go on strikewhat the fuck is going on with our children manthis is horrible teachers are so underpaid to even be put in a situation where this could happenthat s attempted murder not just battery they should throw the book at himattempted murder isn t an overstatementthis easily identifies the kid as a monster he should be tried as an adult and sentenced as such he is redeemablewhat s baby huey doing at school with a full on switch in the first placehe be back on monday because teachers are protected or treated with respect in americaduring semi retirement my husband was a substitute teacher at a high school he had a student offered to sale him drugs he had another student threaten to be waiting on him when he left for the day girls fighting throwing books and cussing he finally had enough and quitand the ridiculous thing is the answer was presented us in covid that violent students should not be denied an education is true then the only safe option for staff and other students is for violent student to do a hybrid at home online schooling where they can be given opportunities to work towards being in the class but if they are too aggressive and violent give them a chromebook and see yah later i wonder then how fast those parents would actually make appointments to get those kidsfuck that kid didn t think it would be that gruesome until i saw the video jeezprison is the correct place for this personthings have gotten worse especially in inner city schools thanks to multiple local and national guidelines and policies passed in the last decade that prohibit or severely limit the use of due to a child behavior the idea may be noble end disproportionate number of minorities being suspended but the end result is a terrible learning environment for the kids who actually want to learn and teachers who actually want to teachthere is zero hope for that kid he will grow up to be a terrible human his parent should face consequences as well this is absurddefinitely should be treated as an adult and face jail time for yearsthe parents are gon na be worsevideo from the incident provided by the sheriff shows the student who is not being identified because he is a minor at 6 6 270 this jackass is not a minor at 17 he needs to be tried as an adultjust put this piece of garbage in jail and forget he is there for a couple of decadeshe needs to be banned from nintendo forever for his own gooddistrict will probably let this steaming pile of shit back to school tooremovedparents need to be punishedcan an iep say the student can only attend classes whose teachers are bigger and more athletic than the student and can that be a reason to expel that student because we do have enough teachers with those qualifications if the iep said that the attack might never have happenedgim me back my switch thrashes wildlythis is an incredibly frightening thingsaw this video for that on reddit the other day that kid is 100 ytaremovedi surprised the cops did cuff the student immediately they let him walk away after assaulting a smaller school employeei used to be a teacher for 5 m not putting my child though public school there is a prison like atmosphere in united states public schools that is unlike the rest of the world america truly hates its childrenjudging from the video i wager good money he both autistic and basically a child mentally from the gaunt to the kicks while he was on the floor to the way he punched it seems extremely reminiscent of an autistic child having a meltdownthis thread is so getting lockedthis country is upside down your parents fought world wars but your children shoot other children and beat up teachers and the authorities protect the children even this giant will be considered a minor shameyet again another story handed to the mainstream news outlets by reddit you welcomei late to the party i commenting on the potential rules and risks involved i using personal experience from years ago before cell phones were in every pocket but some had bringing anything of value to school is a hazardous risk nintendo switch new is usd it can be stolen broken misplaced or the student thought nothing would happen the teacher teaching aide thought otherwise the student retaliated typical rule is put away anything distracting to the class second would been do play with phones or electronics while in class this is assuming there is no no electronic devices on school grounds rules i would also assume the teacher other role would ask the student to put it away first if the student would follow directions then the teacher para would typically tell the student to go to the office they would not put hands on the student or their property because problems like this can and do happen once first contact happens the teacher will be damned if they do damned if they do crapped on by the for assaulting their poor baby or beaten upsounds to me like the parents failed now their child will be screwed out of an education because he was taught to respect his teachers or handle his emotions they should be held just as responsible since he a minori guess mandatory art class your entire academic career really took its toll fuck that kideuthanasia has entered the chatanyone think this is only the first time a switch pun intended was thrown in his head and he got physical i ll bet there s a fat file that will never see the light of day as he s just a childpro tip when a 6 6 270lb anyone threatens your life get help you do need to prove you the adult in charge please stay safe your ego is not worth the pain of death and loss for your loved onesremovedawww poor fuck needed his smash and dragonball in class so bad he had to hurt someone maybe time to get your priorities right and focus on the only free future you get handed to you instead of video gamesremovedremovedremovedtwo things can be true at the same time in this situation 1 this kid committed assault a case could probably be made for attempted murder but i m hardly a legal expert and i prefer to not armchair lawyer through this particular case he should face the consequences of assaulting someone regardless of his special needs 2 the absolutely horrible way the us runs special needs and behavioral therapy systems in our education system public or otherwise is far more at fault for this incident than any individual s actions this kid and the social worker should not have been in a situation like this to begin with and the whole thing could have been avoided if the us took education and special needs even remotely seriously at a systemic levelfuck this kid does not deserve mercy that video was horrifyingswitches get stitches or somethingi m sure desantis will applaud the student s effortsnansay good bye to your cheap chinese made goods and say hello to your cheaper mexican made goods from chinese companies based in mexicothe plans to deploy between 100 and 200 troops to the island in the coming months up from roughly 30 there a year ago i sure this will have greater ramification but i also feel like this is getting blown out of proportion2024 is going to be interestingamericans should have sent jobs to

in mexicoi m gen i m used to this its not our first threat of ww3 in my life i ll crack a beer hit the bong and go out happyguys worried about world war this is actually good news the stronger taiwan is the less likely china is to attackthe arming of japan the new philippine bases and this now is a real middle finger to chinawe are not going to do wwwiii we are so globally interconnected that it would be detrimental to all countries involved china needs the us to keep importing their goods india is dependent on us companies and employment and has some very serious social issue on the home front japan is in the midst of a birth rate calamity south america as a whole has its hands full at the moment russia has botched its ukraine invasion africa is half at war and half in the depth of famine the french have their own immigration thing happening and australia seems to be ok but those guys have large spiders that eat birds so they have other concernsremovedbuy your electronics nowso who s taking bets on which apocalyptic scenario is most likely to actually do us in world war iii successive pandemics antibiotic resistant bacteria or all of the above e the list of earth s magnetic apparently this is not actually dangerous goes full idiocracy slow end i guess caldera flu flaregenuine question here do y all think china looks at russia and what is happening in ukraine and is weighing the likelihood of a protracted war or is figuring that taiwan s relationship with the west will only get stronger and jumps in now i m sure that putin did the same calculus and miscalculated and i m curious as to how much weight xi is putting on the matterat least they re trying to prepare god help all of us right nowbiden walk quietly and swing that big dickcrucial island nationi say this is a good move taiwan is an ally and china has for decades have been threatening itie america learned the lesson of ukraine appeasement does prevent invasions tripwire troops backed up by the greatest military on earth dowill this be the year china fucks around and finds outtaiwan deserves to be freehurry up and buy that gpu or processor you ve been procrastinating on buyingfallout theme piano intensifiesremember when everybody gave trump shit for ratching up tensions with china me neither usa usa usagood china thinks any attempt to deescalate a situation is a sign of weakness and acts accordingly maybe a show of strength will make them think twicethis will definitely tick china off the good thing is it will decrease our reliability on them for goods manufacturinghistory sure do like to repeat itselfca wait for china 15th final warning on the matteri wish our children could know a world where china and taiwan are friends not subjugated would be nicekeep it up with the russia talks china do you want an aircraft carrier group permanently parked in the taiwan strait cause this is how that happensgosh maybe it a bad idea to send weapons to russiachina getting setup for the big they are running out food and people to run the countryfuck china we need to put national security above instant profit for once short term low fruits willl kill uswhoever had the foresight to make it a priority to safeguard chips in taiwan guaranteed the security of the country against china i really want to know who came up with itdoes china not know they are fucked got a few boats and they think there are the shit please let the us show the world how badass our military is that we spend a crazy amount onthis move will also increase tensions in the regionsuper cool america is getting ready to create another pretext to bring freedom to chinajust read an article about the fed having to raise prices and it cause a recession but thank god our massively over bloated military is inserting themselves into yet another situation that will inevitably cause more issues therefore justifying even more military spendinggreat just what we needed to reinvigorate the economy war with chinawe re taking on russia and china at the same time fucking with africa we have the world surrounded by our military but we re the peacekeepers meanwhile ppl live in their tents on the streetdeletedi ve been saying it for the last couple months but the us military seems to have woken up and out their grown up pants on much more aggressive rhetoric and a lot more logistics going on in areas they would have been more timid to touch a few months agoi m worried about this because i don t want the us to fight a war on taiwan and wreck taiwan my parents grew up there my cousins are there and i wan na be able to visit it again someday without everything destroyedi wish this had been done in ukraine i do think putin would have invaded if nato had already deployed there on the other hand i think biden clearly announcing that he would not commit us troops encouraged them to proceed hopefully china takes the warning seriously and hopefully the us follows through on the threat if neededhard line in the sand for china about timei wonder how many of you warmongering redditors will be on the front linesremovedalways wondered why taiwan does welcome a us base compared to okinawa or guamjust imagine if two years ago the has responded to russia in ukraine by sending by such troops to demonstrate its commitment to supporting ukraine and to deterring russian aggressionchina is not an aggressive country and wo risk a war with americadeletedmillions are gon na die for whatwarhawks after crying trump is going to lead us to ww3deletedameriiicaaaaaa fuck yeahhhhhhhyou can just see the media machine starting to droolsee usa is facing a possibility of recession so they have to start unwanted wars to make their friends richremovedif america could stop

also pointed a laser at people from my birthplacesorry ukraine there might be bigger fish to fry soon good luckholy escalations batmanwhy stop at picking a fight with just one nuclear superpower when there is another one right next to the first one we can also pick a fight withnannanhmm know what else causes a people not being able to afford anything but food and therefore not having any purchasing power whatsoever to put back into the economy if wages continue to flatline and inflation continues to soar we are in for some very bad timesso ima be paying 600 every 2 weeks for food now cool edit wow thanks for all the ups guys also for context i live in phoenix normally for me and my 3 kiddos i pay about 300 every 2 weeks for food saturday the same items rang up for 459 and change at walmart says the delivery fee our dollars are falling shorter and shorterokay but clearly the issue is corporations taking advantage of inflation to drastically increase prices so instead of using the fed to curb this maybe the executive and legislative branches should hit these companies with restrictionsthe food i buy has at least doubled in cost you better believe i cutting back on buying other shitso why does corporate america produce more goods and services to meet demandmaybe crack down on the price gouging by the sectors that are artificially driving inflationmeanwhile a kansas city fed report found that corporate price markups were 58 of 2021 inflation https but sure raise interest rates that will fuck over the consumers more than the shareholders at the topor you know start targeting businesses for price gougingwhat do you call inflation where we have year record corporate profitsglad a bunch of people have to lose their jobs to control inflation an awesome system we havetaxing billionaires at 90 will reduce inflation test it for next 50 years to find out for sureits not even inflation its just fucking price gouging companies know they can get away with raising prices without a justified reason and so they arenone of the previous rate hikes took place in a labor market this tight thoughor and hear me out here instead of bending the rest of us over a table why not just do literarily anything to stop the rampant cooperate profiteering that s causing the issuesfed ca but congress could raise taxes on the rich sidenote powell would rather a recession than workers continue to have organized power and power to increase their wagesthat one theory let not forget a lot about fiscal and monitary policy is theory they said when we created tarp there would be massive inflation there was this time about half the inflation over the last 12 months was corporate profiteering no amount of rate hikes will stop thatthis is a failure of fiscal policy not monetary there is industry wide price gouging without any reprecussion raising interest rates is going to fix corporate greed this is a problem that congress needa to solve and the solution is creating a recessionbefore the economic downturn of the late 00s interest rates were much higher than they are now lowering interest rates was supposed to be a stop gap to aid in the recovery they were never supposed to stay that low for this long so in a way we never fully recovered from that and we continue to pay the pricethe fed ca control inflation with interest rates this time interest rates were used to control demand and thus inflation in the past inflation is being caused by the forces of monopoly strategic leveraging of key businesses and commodities this time not by demand trickle down has become vacuum up the only way to fix the extortion economy is to re engage the government and force business to break up and compete this can only be done with high taxes on the rich to fix the wealth inequality that has been growing for decades the only curve for corporate greed is taxation and regulation time to end the free ride for capitalistsit almost like there is a huge amount of money being hoarded away from the majority of the populationwe re already in a changing the definition doesn t change that it s already here 6 eggs is fucking ridiculoussure raise interest to make the average person s mortgage even harder to pay or to make people who have no access to ludicrous amounts of capital borrow at a higher rate instead of i dunno a windfall tax to make price gouging pointlessyou say inflation i say price gouging by companies who see we still buy things even during pandemicsthat katie porter vs jamie dimon video needs more exposuregroup of millionaires decide you need to lose your job to stop inflation and improve their stock portfolios ithow about we just actually tax all the companies thst are making record profits month after monthif you look around you can find a paper saying whatever you want economists have a whole bunch of opinionswhat horse our government lives in the same pockets of the companies that are price gouging us while paying us crap and there not a single person that can change my mind on that the class war is coming all of this political divisiveness is little more than a dog and pony show to distract us from the total corruption edit for clarityshould people pay 10 more for milk and eggs or be out of a job and unable to afford either fed are saying millions being unable to afford either is necessary of course the paradigm presented above is false the truth is the fed does care how much the average consumer pays for anything the is the reason for taming inflation rather wealthy people are sitting on enormous amounts of cash capital and wo spend any of it until prices crash wealthy folks are waiting for foreclosures and liquidations so they can convert their money into assets for pennies on the dollargood thing we kept interest rates so low for so long and also taxes too you think next time when things are good we will raise taxes a bit and raise interest rates so we have somewhere to go in a recession nah pedal to the metal all gas no breaks baby run this baby until it explodesthe only folks buying lux goods are wealthy working class stiffs are getting killed everywhere with groceries being huge along with utilities so what is fueling the inflation oh wait it is because we have more jobs that actually earn a living wage and we just ca have that give those people more money but then charge more to knock them back downeconomy driven by greedand it allegedly our fault because we use emojis and only eat avocado toastit not inflation it price gouging and the evidence is in the record corporate profitsi m starting to wonder and don t blast me too hard here this is just a hypothesis we need to stop entertaining ourselves we need to start feeling the true weight of our lack of money we need to come fully to terms with the fact that no we can t go on a road trip just to have a nice dinner a couple towns over because we can t afford the extra gas consumption and the restaurant is a little too nice for our budget i believe a long time ago capitalist us realized if we are sufficiently entertained we are less likely to do anything i mean look at how hard the entertainment industry has been propped up of course a lot of it is artists just wanting to share their hearts and minds but who do they have to go through to get that out to us companies of course who likely understand their role in keeping their role in check john smith can t afford to go on a vacation let alone a road trip to bring his kiddos to see grandma anymore because john smith can t take a day off work can t waste precious gas and the kids always want to buy snacks from the gas station on the way there so john decided they ll just call grammy up on video chat when he gets off work at 8 pm now this is all good and well that grammy gets to see and hear her loved ones but the point is forgotten that john smith can t afford a day trip to go see his own mother not until payday and then he ll have to decide between going and seeing her or buying his son a game that just went on sale online to distract his son from the fact that his dad can t afford to put him in an after school sport where he would undoubtedly have more fun and it would be far more stimulating for him of course that last bit is gon na piss some gamers off let it be known i too am a gamer but i also played sports growing up until my family became so broke when i was in hs where it was no longer feasible but i joined the cheapest sport there was wrestling of course video games are great they teach a lot of different skills but no more and none greater than what is taught in person to person games on a team of people you have learned to know and respect over a period of time these are just two small examples of the things in life we let slip away because hey might not be able to afford a trip driving through our country but we can watch some goofy semi wealthy influencer do it instead and if we squint our eyes we can almost imagine ourselves there we ve been told our whole lives this is your life you choose how to live it then that power was slowly taken from us and we were given increasingly shittily produced movies to keep us happy and many many movies i ve seen have repeatedly taken digs at society incredibles 2 was rife with it and i couldn t stop myself from looking about the room this was legitimately like hearing someone a talk mad shit about person b mentioning how pathetic they are and as person c you re blown away because person b is standing right there but person a used just the right words so person b feels like it wasn t about them and you as person c are getting really sick of all of these digs at society just being thrown up as a big joke that we re all in on except we re the butt of the joke and we laugh along that s how good the entertainment industry has gotten they can make digs at the state of our lives put a line somewhere in the monologue that says something to the affect of but you aren t gon na do anything are you what can you do and we all say ha what a great movie i love so and so actor oh and the cgi was so realistic it was almost like i was in their world this is of course a fucking novel and i highly doubt the vast majority will make it this far but to wrap it all up maybe it s time we stop pretending we care about being entertained maybe it s time we stop looking for distractions and we feel the true burn of how little of real life we truly can enjoy we let that pain hurt and we take that pain and guide it to the realization that we could have stood up at any point if we truly understood just how destitute we d become when we aren t always distracted just a hypothesis though i ve been wrong before edit i mean what the hell with how easy things should be nowadays compared to how fucking grueling life was way back whenever i would imagine the last thing the us economy would ever want is people actively feeling their lack of power and instead of being distracted meeting up and starting their own organizations with real representation of the people standing up and saying now wait a minute we ve been feeling out just how broken this shit is and we re backed by the people oh what am i saying that would probably land the organization on a list long before they ever did anything criminala paper written by the guy who was on the fed from 06 to 08 hmm i wonder what happened in 08 that would cause a reshuffling of the fed board he also wrote a paper in 06 saying iceland s economy was very strong and there was nothing to worry about hmm what happened to the icelandic economy in 08 that would in fact prove that to be absolute bullshit the author is a right winger paid by china they want a recession they re wishing it into existence they profit if we doevery market in the world has been showing to be more resilient than expected except for britain so fartax the rich pay higher wages and don t let hedge fund buy up the housing market tax away any profits they might make simpleit s called let s jail corporate profiteersremovedit really does feel like raising mortgage rates is helping anything people are still struggling to afford everything is still super and now they struggling to afford a house tooyes raising rates on poor people is the answerfed be like hmmm inflation was this percentage and then doesn t blink when corporations subsequently raise prices by three times that amounthow about we outlaw stock buybacks and allow congress the oversight necessary to make sure these corporations stop taking public money and then laying people off or we can keep pretending like the market is some untameable beast that acts with impunity that what has gotten us herehad powell did his job in the trump days we would be in this bs by the time trump left office the interest rates should have been about and at least a 5 in biden first year biden should have never kept him in the fedthe fed ca go after corporations either that congressthis economy is not like any traditional form of inflation causing a recession is going to stop it the problem is intentional and the goal is to funnel more money up to the 1 they just see a recession as a fire sale for other people stuffor they could grow a spine and start enforcing laws and start fighting this problem at the source executive board roomsthe fed couldn t but companies could also have settled with their previous record profits instead of gouging their way to new record profits when inflation is 8 and you increased prices by 50 you don t get to blame inflationit s like chemotherapy to cure cancer poison the patient and hope the cancer cells die before the patient does except that inflation really erodes capital so this is killing the holding class to preserve the capital holding class same old story right alongside union busting etcthe rich don t seem to be suffering at alldawg i pretty sure this inflation is self made by the 1 percent to just blatantly take money hey man this war is the perfect excuse to raise prices on everything watch all the massive corporate gains just pile up while they were just raising to prices to match rising costsmake stock buybacks illegal and cap and investor compensation to a ratio of average employeegouging laws would help a lotwhich will increase unemployment because the tech firms living vc paycheck to vc paycheck won t get the funding they need to stay in business i guess if no one is working and can t afford shit on unemployment that s one way to combat inflationmaybe time to step up price gougingmust be all that avocado toast we are eating i ll put a couple backi bet it because profiteering is inflation do forget these geniuses blamed the start of inflation on wage increases no one was getting then it was lack of workers then corps starting laying everyone one off it not inflationcorporate greed is the number one cause of rising prices the answer is to tax the fuck out of them unless they lower prices corporations are posting record profits for the last 6 quartersso when are we going to do a general strike and shut this country down so we can get shit fixeddo we have to believe this nonsense wake up people the corporations who are making record profits from price fixing also own the media outlets that churn this precum journalism readying you for another soulless fuckingour government has failed us we need a new system this checks and balances thing is flawed people are poor with no insurance and have no means to grow or travel greatthe problem is too many people with too high of employment making too much money the problem is monopolies making huge profits because they can charge what they want do raise interest rates raise taxes windfall taxes and billionaire taxes and wealth taxes andbullshit regulate the companies making record profits especially the ones that provide basic needs like food and utilitiesi mean we could extremely aggressively tax corporate profits and capital gains but then how would all that money ever trickle downwe literally saw what happens to an economy when people don t spend money three years ago the system is bullshit if the only answer is to hurt people in order to protect the systemor we could actually crack down on price gouging which is i pretty sure against the lawya know what a simple way to fix it stop letting companies price gouge and excuse it away with the inflationokay but inflation really isn t that bad what s extremely bad right now is companies massively hiking prices under the guise of inflation inflation is why are prices going up unconstrained corporate greednext headline corporate profits at record highsremember when they said they could raise wages because everything would go up in price well everything went up in price anyway and we did get our raise funny how that worksthey could easily tame inflation with some fucking antitrust suits these giant monopoly companies are hurting for cash they charging more because they can and are calling it inflationcorporate profits are at record but that is greed and not inflationinflation is the problem its the abuse of corporations to make money on inflation but never lose money in a depression if wadges rose with inflation this would not be a problem but company make more money now than they did before because of a lack of enforcement by the us government there is no reason for a company to fear inflation because their ceo are allowed to pay themselves whatever they wantthe only thing that will take care of inflation is demand destruction companies now have a baked in excuse to raise prices even if inflation were to decrease they re not lowering prices until people stop buying their producthow it is possible to have no employees but record inflation me thinks something is amissor hear me out tax the ever loving piss out of corporations who claim there are rising prices and somehow have quarterly reportings of 10 growth looking at you galenremember in 2019 when we bailed out wall street banks again with trillion dollars one would think printing 80 of all us dollars in the last 3 years would be headline worthy man i wonder what s causing all this inflationeasy raise taxes on businesses with more than 500 employees it been known for many months that most of the inflation is artificial created by companies taking advantage of the war in ukraine and initial spike in costs that were associated with that to raise their prices raise taxes on big businesses and you see costs come down quickbecause this is a problem of excess money it a problem of vertically integrated systems causing artificial scarcity and making prices high to harvest record profits you ca use interest rates to stop that you have to use the power of the government to break up the trusts which is why republicans are break up the fucking trusts or bustsure they can the government can just stop spending money they do haveso glad i got a 4 raid this year will only be a 10 pay cutrecession i in let do thisit not inflation it record profitssystem is meant for a slave class that will be priced out of society two tierslooks at corporations making massive profitssounds like we should probably start regulating those companies who are making record profits right now or somethingturns out that when you waste 8 trillion dollars on a war on terror 2 trillion on gfc stimulus and then another 5 trillion on a pandemic there are economic repercussions thoughtwhy ca they limit price on companies if they ca spontaneously raise prices 150 then inflation wo happen go to the root cause to solve the problem profiteering should be sacred and untouchablethey should start going after all the companies that are price gouging with record profits i bet that inflation go down real quickmaybe maybe maybe look into the fucking corporate price gouginghiw about increasing taxes on the 1 and big corps to remove money from the economy to reduce inflationbut raising taxes for the rich won t even be considered so recession affecting people it is this will let rich people get all resources at bargain prices people will elect a right wing government that will make things even worse rich people will get even richer the 99 percent will get screwed againtax the rich already all these articles trying to tell us we are doomed if we do buckle down all because they ca fathom taxing greedor you know actually capping prices of certain goodswhy don t we discipline greedy corporations instead of the workersok i ll just keep affording 9 milk and 13 eggs thank god they prevented a recession also what recession american companies are making billions of tax thembro the billionaires will come to regret all of this stupid shit they are slowly but at an increasing rate killing the goose that is laying the golden eggs people will soon not be able to afford the shit they are selling and then what they already had massive profits and they will lose everything in a violent uprising because they wanted morethat because it not inflation it price gouging start by breaking up monopolies like we did with the trusts back in the day and tax the absurdly wealthy into the groundi mean maybe if congress would just enforce the fucking laws about price gouging we would have this problem but god forbid that happenthey do want ubi but they doing everything in their power to make sure it the only alternative to riotsthis this current situation does qualify as a recession well shitthey could start jailing ceos who increased prices for no reason other than making more moneyat what point do we revolt the rich and powerful are bleeding every fucking penny out of us and we just keep letting them biden and the democrats are going to help us trump desantis or whichever gop fascist you like is going to help us we must help usthe ruling class wants a recession the average person has way too much agency right now there was an email that got leaked by someone high up at wells fargo or bank of america a few months back about thisnanit cold my neighbors are at a hotel we just got a generator going with a space heater 100 getting a switch wired in so i can run my whole panel on that thing because this keeps happeningedit the ice storm was wednesday evening followed by wind gusts of 45mph thursday evening and they promising 95 back online by sunday evening edit edit updated article here https edit edit edit here is a link to a live outage map by dte one of the biggest providers https zip map has the most detail weather is currently below freezing for the third night at check for anecdotal accounts love from the metro 3my power is out and supposedly coming back sunday night im able to stay at my partners parents house so i don t freeze but i can t get any of my work done and am losing a ton of food it is very stressfulthe real concern here is the number of elderly affected dte should be covering much more than just food loss imagine being 90 and trying to maintain a generator and a fire just to not freeze to death in your sleepyeah this is what happens when you plan your communities on open farmland and then after 70 years of poor forestry management practices they turn into urban forests i know everyone shits on the utility but tree damage is the main cause of downed power lines heremy power went out twice but not for very long back up generator i put in last year worked perfectly all of the trees had about a quarter inch of ice on them i m in sw mi still a lot out over here homes over 500 homes that is a lot in the country out within a couple miles of mine with no cause assessed or crews assigned and as the estimated restoration date consumers httpsi hope they get power back soon and i just have to say every time i think i sick and tired of living in the pacific northwest i read about all the natural disasters power outages etc that happen pretty much everywhere else in the country but here and i feel just a bit more comfortable staying heremichigans power grid is garbage and companies like dte are as criminally corrupt as pg egot power back on friday lost it again saturday afternoon still freezing in the dark this sucksmy power thankfully came back after 18 hours but since more than 10 of customers lost power this is a catastrophic event so i not eligible for the paltry 25 disruption credit i have 5 aquariums so i am thankful it came back on before the ambient temperature got too low i have to buy a small generator to run the 750w of heaters for the next catastrophic event in monthsi there most of the state is just fine the majority of outages are along the southern of the state in lansing the ice was melted before the wind started so nothing happened grand rapids was mostly snowpower corrupts and not having any power certainly reduces corruption this is one way to ensure cleaner politics in michiganyeah it was pretty crazy i was stuck in a traffic jam today that was caused just by the fact that multiple lights were out in a highly populated area i was affected thankfully but some of my family members werehow is this even possible get here and our power grid is just finehope everyone stays safe until it back up and here hoping they can stick to the two day timeline instead of taking weeks like texasdeletedcurrent outage map shows few than 100k still without powerreasons why i have battery banks hell i got a campaign fan that has enough juice to illuminate for teo nights and charged phone once or no illumination and charge twice should really see if there is a wallet sized firestarter out there so thing in pocket can give precious fire course dems a lotta people and hope many of them live close to a hospital those grids come up hella quickremovedvoter suppression weakens the will of its citizenswhy did we not bury electric linesdeletedi always impressed when i see those figures and then pakistan httpsnanby you mean the same bookswe should all be clear that these proposed changes were specifically from the authorized uk publisher publishers in the us and in europe never subscribed or participated or intended to do any such thing httpsthis whole thing feels like a new coke vs coke classic marketing stuntmy personal theory is that companies are finding ways to use cancel culture talk to get publicity this isn t the first instance and won t be the lastthis was a successful pr campaign thencampaign working just like they intended i hear palpatine gooooooood somewhere in the distancei hate when stuff like this happens and people think it was all faked as part of a marketing stunt new coke the sonic movie redesign etc you people are really giving a lot of credit to corporate executives the type of people who are generally known to be woefully out of touch at nearly all timesfake cancel culture the publisher invented this controversy trying to spur more book salesman they just gained a shitload of press for these books i bet they are hoping it turns into salesthis almost seems like it was intentional 1 make the changes 2 inform a journalist discretely on a slow news day 3 let the outrage flow 4 profitfrancesca dow managing director of penguin random house children s said the publisher had listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of roald dahl s books and the very real questions around how stories from another era can be kept relevant for each new generation it called an annotated edition you leave the text intact on the left page and the right page has explainers for idioms jargon or background information to provide contextreddit when this story was announced well the right does much worse things reddit now oh it was all a clever marketing ruse because no one actually believes thisand that s how you make money off of right wing nut jobslooks like the old coca cola strategywe going to remove all acts of violence from every

grief what a batch of snozzwangersrepublish this you fucking cowards https in the version first published the a tribe of amiable black pygmies who have been imported by willy wonka from the very

their new circumstances and particularly with their diet of chocolate before they lived on green caterpillars beetles eucalyptus leaves and the bark of the treethis is so calculated and transparent peak marketingi heard they were republishing william burroughs with all the sex and drug use edited out so babies could read itdon t be fooled this is about profit and nothing else if it is believed that the texts have become offensive or unpalatable for a current generation then in order to sell copies controversial wording is changed in an effort to sell more copies to a modern clientele sure this may seem fine but there is historical value in getting a glimpse of what other time periods were like good and the bad we should learn from it in this case it backfired and they made headlines so either way they profitpenguin to publish classic roald dahl book after tricking people into giving them a bunch of free publicity there fixed it for you would any of us even know or even be talking about it if they just republished the books without all the recent bsi find it funny how a lot of it completely destroyed the stuff kids really enjoy about his books it like the sterile red riding hood stories where she is eaten the hunter does cut open the wolf or pippis dad not being a king for some black island dwellers in the south pacific that the stuff kids love and it a reason those dark and scary stories made it through history they work they make kids think and they prepare them for the shit that is life in a safe but also fun and approachable way sure make sterile derivatives all you want but do try to pass it off as anything but especially as a large publisher expect backlashgood the darkness of dahl writing is part of what makes it so wonderfulaw shucks guess we got ta sell booki will be purchasing a copy of each maybe even two copies of eachenid blyton collectors edition on the way if this goes wellpenguin should call them diaper baby edition and i can wear big kid pants editionyes common sense won there is some goodness in the world stillah the new coke strategywould it just make sense to do something like write a forward providing the reader with some context and explaining how the phraseology of the text was acceptable and totally normal for works written during that time period why alter anything forwards explaining situations or context or just acknowledging that it is a piece of literature written during a different time and it would be doing readers a disservice to alter the text is that like ignoring history and being doomed to repeat it or some shitwe ll introduce it as new slurm and then reintroduce slurm classic and make billionswhy do we just kill every person with any disagreeable views burn all the media expressing them and create a utopia because obviously discrimination would never come back after all memory of history atrocities is erased right is that how it works to be clear about my views here this sort of revising censorship is essentially lobotomizing history memory trying to pretend it never existed instead of accepting where we been and how we progressed once these memories are erased we be at risk for repeats of the very things we repressedthey created false outrage to sell more bookswhy ca these people just put an foreword saying so yeah this work is almost 100 years old and has some outdated bullshit that is really wrong by today standards like a normal person wouldthe whole thing was nuts to begin with these are books from a place in time in our history erasing history is a dangerous affair in my opinionpenguin to publish roald dahl books after publicity stunt ftfythe whole thing is dumb as fuck they are words in a book of fiction people need to stop being offending by everything ffs never used to be like this when did we start getting offended by everything x200b might as well just censor the whole book this is as bad as when movies have stuff cut out because of censorshipif they were so quiet about the original move i have bet that this was an iq1000 move to increase salesultimately no matter how much i may disagree or agree or care or not care regarding a book contents or a person views i never agree with censorship and silencing regulated and kept away from easily influenced minors in some cases at least outside supervised classrooms and such yes but not censored and silenced i mean the obvious implication that this was a pr stunt aside just a general opinion right theregood i think history and literature should not be destroyed or censored even when it ugly it should be given context and education when nessecary dahl was an and used language and concepts that are harmful but were common at the time he deserves that stain on his legacy but i also think discrimination against specific groups is not an inherent trait in people it is learned from one environment dahl was also an amazing children author his work can be enjoyed with guidance and education from parents and schoolsi am 52 years old i remember charlie and the chocolate factory from the third grade oompa loompas we re from oompa loompa land here is the thing they had already edited out that oompa loompas were just africans they made them little orange skinned people but in the original books they had been africans from africa why cause it was incredibly racist of ronald dahl in the first placeso they doing a new coke offering a revision that no one asked for in order to draw up support for the original which gets a classic tacked onto the namewhat genius thought they were better at writing than dahl bet he was from the marketing departmenti have mixed feelings on this on the one hand there the argument of maintaining the author work versus changing it later on i get why the changes might have been made but i also feel like as opposed to the seuss books that were pulled the changes i saw were that badly needed and the books affected were actually the more popular ones there also the possibility that there was some wording in need of being changed that i missed it been a while since i read those books both were done with the permission of the estate but when changes have been made i like for it to be sold as an altered version i also feel like at least in this case purchasing the original version should still be an option i would want an altered version of to kill a mockingbird for example because i do want to soften the blow of how some of the harder parts land it was tough to read at times and i feel like it should be due to the nature of the story being told but for that same reason i can also see why someone else might want an altered version there also the fact that the seuss books are heavily illustrated there no good way to really alter those without also changing the illustrations and i feel like that would be changing too much of the original to sell it like it the original artist creation pulling those i feel was probably the best option for them there in this particular case i think maybe selling both versions would be a good compromisemarketing campaign has been an absolute success outrage sells babyim gona buy em just to send the message that cancel culture is fucking stupidthey should just print the originals and forget about trying to rewrite historyi thought both versions were available alreadymarketing in the age of outrage dahl book sales will spikeis this like stopping to kill a mocking bird or catcher in the rye i remember back in high school they were saying these books were originally banned or something i don t remember america is getting softstop changing stuff books are a snapshot into the lives and times of their creators this sometimes does coincide with today sentiments but it should be changed for it take it as a lesson of how much civilization has moved forward instead of as a slightleave everything alone this is really stupid and shallowso many people are butthurt that the update says oompa loompas are instead of the outrage is such a stretch they fixed a word whose meaning changed over time why pick this bullshit to care aboutgenuine question to everyone in this thread who is dramatically opposed to ever editing a children book roll with me for a second here i making the following assumptions 1 dahl wrote for pretty young kids like range 2 is kind of young for a disclaimer at the front of the book to really be effective like your eight year old is going to understand which parts of the book might be or or or whatever for the most part 3 the books are really intended to be read by the kids not by adults i know i went through basically all of my roald dahl books by myself with nobody reading them to me given all that exactly what do you think we should do with classic children literature once the author dies throughout this thread everyone says that he was allowed to change his own books but obviously he dead now so he ca change them anymore and everyone is saying we ca change them but is the natural outcome of that logic that eventually we just ca let eight year olds read them anymore eight is really old enough for a disclaimer on the cover to help you need to do a guided reading and literally help your kid understand which parts are wrong which completely destroys the experience of the book like it one thing when it books for middle and high school aged kids those are usually encountered in a classroom setting there structure you can discuss that stuff presenting those books as written and discussing them as artifacts of their time makes sense because that a thing we set up and prepared to do i not sure that realistic for books targeting 8 year olds it kind of feels like the end result of all this ca change it since he dead now is that the books just eventually ca be read at all by their intended audience because they simply too out of dateit s almost like it was an elaborate marketing techniquethis has me feeling it a marketing stunt for reissuesand hardly anyone cared enough to buy the i not actually a hateful person but i hate you for making children less hateful editionshow could they know that censorship would be poorly received by the literateso we re getting the original catcf before that classic children s novel was tweaked the oompa loompas were literally african pygmies that wonka had enslavedthis has been a brilliant piece of marketingcan we all acknowledge that the venn diagram of the people who complained about the editing and the people who actually read books do overlapanyone smell marketing ployi glad the fattys in charge are selling this as intendedi m really sorry that the word fat is so important to you here s a clue though if you are pissed about people not wanting to be ridiculed because it changes the way you talk maybe it s you that s the problemas they should honestly it s not like there s anything horrendously offensive in any of them and tbh even if there were revising books and history is a dangerous path to go downfeel like dahl s insane needs to be mentioned over needlessly changing certain character aspectseverything has to go through a fucking cancel filter find some way to demonize judy blume nextremovedthere is hope maybe folks will stop rewriting history soonthe thing i hated most about this debacle is how it clearly was a marketing stunt to get people upset about fictitious culture wars specifically people take the changing of fat to enormous part of the controversy people were like oh they protecting the feelings of the fatties and using it as a way to soapbox about fat people even though the vast majority of fat positive folks are actively trying to destigmatize the word yet people fell for the outrage bait hook line and sinker because it easier to get people to rally against an imaginary boogie man than cobble together a new ad campaign i supposehey it worked for cokethis was kinda like the new coke situation loltotally not or anythingwhy do people care so much one way or the other why is this major newsa backlash from people who do read in the first placedisney takes pinocchio little mermaid beauty and the beast alice in wonderland the jungle book cinderella and others and modifies the story to be appropriate to the audiences when they were released and no one bats an eye a publisher makes minor non story changes to a children s book to ensure they remain appealing to modern readers and everyone loses their minds seriously this is the most ridiculous kind of woke panic these books are products meant to be sold times changethank goodness now i will use my freedom of choice to buy neitherthis feels like a crystal pepsi or new slurm kind of situationthis stinks of a disingenuous free marketing campaign like when skittles switched out lime for apple just so peoplw would talk about how much they liked lime better and then they put back in lime and suddenly those people felt compelled to buy skittlesokay i need sleep i read the title and was for some reason thinking of the penguin from batman publishing booksas long as they call fat people fat no one gives a shiti don t see how anyone can legitimately care either way at first i was like oh no then i was like who then i was enjoying people who had strong opinions the most if you have a strong opinion either way you re probably the kind of kid who needed the edits let me stress the either way part of my last statementim ok with this so long as the church releases classic pictures of jesus where he not a cornfed blue eyed europeansome people on here are sounding like trumpers with all the conspiracies this is a simple case of some progressives going too far and being puritanical censors why is that so hard to admit not everything is a right wing conspiracy to make woke people look bad sometimes your own side can be moronsif i m not mistaken the changes to the books were basically just some ip renewal stuff basically the same shit warren beatty does with the movie rights to dick tracywe live in a world that is sanitized to never offend anyone ever at any time oops i think i offended someoneit new coke all over againit was all just a ploy to sell more booksmaking the changes was all about perceived public opinion so makes sense they change it back they just want to make some moneyredneck says no redding on muh watchif real i expect all those free speech warriors to be upset that a company got bullied into reversing their speech i mean it is all about free speech righti m okay with two versions we in america already have abridged and unabridged versions of classics we also have illustrated classics made for young readers so they can read the book faster and without any racist or sexist parts that may be in the original good example is the adventures of huckleberry finn the original version of the text has 300 uses of the n bomb you can still purchase the book unabridged with all the n bombs in it or you can purchase a abridged censored version without and i don t care about wether you read which version just as long as the original messages themes or tones remain the samethe mob strikes againi mean the ones that were changed totally changed the general tone of the writing it like they were just changing his general choice of descriptions i not sure if this was even meant to really go through or if it was just to get a reaction out of peopleediting books is ridiculous massive exaggeration obviously but should we mein kampf as well old books should be touched they a learning toolgreat it was always just about selling books anyway if they can sell the books as originally written they do that and if they can sell books with overt racism edited out because that what people want to buy then do that too you publishers you publish books that sell copiesnanyou do have to agree with it but this is the stuff that makes the west infinitely better than russiapeople have given their lives so that these people have the right to do this not even madi get peace activists want peace but what the alternative to ensuring ukraine can fight russia allowing russia to conquer ukraine does that set a precedent for even more conquestuseful idiots exist in every country it seems glad the german government and grand majority of german people are smarter than these protestorsthose who do not know our history are doomed to repeatcan we get this title changed to be more accurate something like shitheads gather in berlin to show support for tyrannical dictator illegal invasiongerman finance minister whoever does not stand by ukraine is on the wrong side of history i think most of the world agreesso they support russia decimating ukraine then moving on to other countries such as moldova and polandhey idiots remember the last time the former russia visited germany i guess nota demonstration against supplying ukraine with weapons for war with russia attracted people on saturday drawing criticism from top german government officials and a large police presence to maintain order organised by a prominent german politician the protest comes a day after the anniversary of russia invasion of ukraine which drew promises of more weapons from western allies fresh sanctions against russia and shows of support for kyiv across the globe we call on the german chancellor to stop the escalation of arms deliveries now because every day lost costs up to more lives and brings us closer to a 3rd world war the protest organizers said on their website the uprising for peace was organised in part by sahra wagenknecht a member of germany die linke party germany along with the united states has been one of the biggest suppliers of weapons for ukraineare these protesters really that and uneducated or were they including rewards to participate and spread their nonsense shamei guess these folks forgot what life was like to the east back when there was an east and west germanythere was tens of thousands protesting against masks plenty of stupid to be found plenty of russian money to be found aswelyes germany is a democracy and their citizens can protest against protecting themselves against putin invading germany one daywell we know who is getting paid off by putin in germanygermans that don t know their own history we already know what happens when the world let s a country invade their neighbors 1 by 1do you want to arm ukraine so their citizens fight russia instead of your own makes sense to me if i was a leaderso an left really does exist just not in the usathey probably miss the good ol days when they were the ones invading countries and committing genocidefucking idiots if it was for nato putin would be marching from ukraine to warsaw to berlini mean i m all for freedom of speech bully for these idiots but i do wonder just how many of these screamers are the product of the tens of millions of rapes the soviets committed in germany and how many remember that stalin enthusiastically backed nazi germany when they were both exterminating poles insane that any german could ever again side with russia onthere are a ton of expat russians lobbing in germany enjoying the west freedom but still loving russiathousands you say was this in berlin wisconsin by chance if this was in germany then this is kind of clumsy to put on a news sub for american domestic news it feels just desperatethey must all be under 30i like to take a peek at the financials of the organizers especially the far left wing person that set it up i all about free speech in any country but the sheeple that are in tow on these talking points should be confident on who selling them before taking a standgood i m glad they congregate to be identifiedsome of them signed a petition giving their names and addresses right maybe they should be visitednanmeasles is so contagious there been a documented case of transmission after going into an elevator and using it 1 hour after a child with measles rode it it lingers in the air for a couple hours this is the sort of thing when you get triaged at a hospital its through a window with you standing outsidethe year is 2023 easily preventable and highly infectious deadly diseases are becoming more common again as people decide to live in disinformation bubbles which makes them feel good instead of taking easy to access and incredibly safe and vetted vaccines fucking morons causing big problems because they stupid and likely narcissisticthis asbury thing was jesus weighing in against thethey revived measles superi would guessed that a covid outbreak would have been more likelyif anyone else was wondering why a university was hosting a revival asbury is a private christian university i tie that to being and extreme but at a glance it seems they actually a decent university with no big stance on vaccines still anyone attending a revival is probably not riding the leading wave of science and medicine so maybe take a break from chatting with the sky guy and vaccinate your children against preventable illnesses pleasethanks jenny mccarthydoes university mean something else in kentuckywe have an asbury here in tulsa oklahoma and they recently left the methodist church because it was too progressive not surprised to hear another asbury is and rightwingstrange you would have thought god would have protected themgod plan to infect someone with measles why would he want harm to come to his own worshippers who knowsnone of them should have been unvaccinated look a restaurant can refuse entry

security of the united the attorney s office saidhe make it into the cyber awareness challengehe fucked up by not being a president orin 2017 however law enforcement officers discovered that birchum had removed more than 300 classified files or documents including more than 30 items marked top secret from authorized locations to his home his overseas officer s quarters and a storage pod in his driveway prosecutors say birchum had two documents on a thumb drive in his home that contained information relating to the national security agency s capabilities and methods of collection and targets vulnerabilities both documents were classified as top and their unauthorized release could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the united the attorney s office said in a this guy was going to retire and then sell this shit 10 years seems a little short on time to mewhen i left the military the last fucking thing i wanted was anything anchoring me to that same military or keeping me under their jurisdiction as well when you are in you are well aware of how important classified documents are and how much they need to be protected zero excuseon a thumb drive how old were these documents the usb ports on all the classified computers i ever used didn t allow thumb drives they sent an alert if you tried to plug one ini really starting to think that we need some sort of system to better track classified documents and inform the people in charge when they are not returned on time i mean really should there be some sort of check system for sensitive information like this how do so many people just have them sitting in their homesthe president and vice president are basically on duty all the time their house the plane they use anytime they travel they bring their portable office with them when they leave office it is normal to have a few classified documents by mistake and when they are found they are promptly turned in what is different about this case and the trump case is that both of them appeared to have gathered very highly classified documents and tried to hide them the lt colonel obviously should have had any top secret documents at all trump lied several times and tried to hide his top secret documents even today there is a report that after the fbi searched his office classified documents were moved back there in an attempt to hide themhold on now i know a whole family of regular ass citizen chucklefucks who were caught with boxes full of classified documents who knows who they sold those to and they are getting charged with anything does seem fairwhy did he just store it in his garage next to his corvette where it definitely safeeverybody check your garage this weekend for classified documentssecurity clearance

norfolk southern is paying million to derailment victims meanwhile it s shelling out billion for shareholders httpsthey are starting to freak out they will start with low payouts but will lean on their paid politicians to help them out they already did a photo shoot of them drinking water hope they loose a few billiongreat add 4 more zeroes to that number and then nationalize the rail industry to prevent this mismanagement from ever happening againso just a quick google search said that they had a profit of billion last year this payout is and some change of their profits last year if your household made last year and had to cover this you would be paying so what incentive is there to fix anythingit s a literal crime they were allowed to turn the soil over and patch the rail immediately

starting pointnorfolk southern should start start with 1 billion in cash to be administered by some trustworthy 3rd party subject to regular public auditsthe real damage will be in the billions

on a zero to each and then we begin talking about actual restitution more appropriate would be to swap the figures and then add a zero or twonanso from what i read you have to see your healthcare provider at least once in person to be prescribed the meds you need and then you can get refills over the phone am i correcti feel like they saying that this is to prevent fraud or whatever but in reality our infrastructure ca handle everyone being diagnosed we ca get medicine for everyone who needs it so we have to tell fewer people that they need it or make getting it so different that people who need medication just give up on trying to get it when you look at all the hoops someone with adhd has to jump through to get medicated it looks an awful lot like it was designed to screen out a percentage of people who do legitimately need it like adhd literally makes you bad at all the stuff you need to do to treat it imagine if you needed to run a marathon to get a wheelchairthis isn t helpful so many people rely on telehealth to get help because there s nobody in their area who provides the servicedo they seek to start forcing psychiatrists to see patients in person because that damn near impossiblethe dea has grown increasingly concerned over the last two years that some of those startup telehealth companies are improperly prescribing addictive substances like opioids or attention deficit disorder medication okay so take all that war on drugs energy and direct it towards those companies doing that that money followthe trail hook those big fish boys but then again conglomerates pay good money so as to not raise such a stink some call it lobbying but the other name it goes by is bribery escobar had nothing on these folksi have a hard enough time getting adderall between appointment openings being delayed for months and shortages to the point that i having to ration and hope i can pull through in a reduced attentive state to jump through the hoops before the withdrawals set inchrist almighty another hoop for adhd medications when there s already a damned shortage how did i know these would be the medications thrown in with opioids under the overprescribed umbrella ughhhhhhhhh i just like functioning like a normal adult leave my concerta aloneusa we have a mental health problem in this country the world what are you going to do about it usa make it harder for people to get the medication they need to manage their mental health issues the world usa whattelehealth needs expansion not more useless regulation entirely too many people go without medical treatment because in person treatment is a barrier especially during a pandemic where the most vulnerable or not being protected by proper precautions like mandatory building hepa filtration mandatory masking mandatory vaccination etc and that even if you have a specialist in your area at all that will take your insurance even before the pandemic i was having problems axis in care and my primary care physician was having to handle everything despite my needing consultation with specialists on my care management team which i have gotten in years in other words many disabled people like myself have a care management team of one their primarystop fucking lumping in stimulants with opiates it borderline impossible to abuse vyvanse recreationally anywaythought this was already a requirement my psych changed my last appointment to in person still allows for telehealth after that i thought it was something like i need an in person appointment once every two years maybe its local thing just a minor gripe that they said refills in the article you do refill controlled substances we have to get separate prescriptions it sounds similar but its not there are more hoops to jump through for something as arbitrary as writing 3 prescriptions instead of 1 with 2 refills the things we do to pretend we are being more secure is astounding its ridiculous because there is nothing they need me in person for yes we need to crack down on the app telehealth services but there are other ways besides making things more obnoxious for the rest of us for no gain the people misusing are almost more likely to jump through these hoops than the people who actually need it adhd meds are on there and every additional hoop makes it especially when not on meds due to the shortage how about the dea just prosecutes the pill mills go after the source quit making it patients problemthis is ridiculous it essentially the same rules as prior to the pandemic the dea is acting as if the past three years did happen all because two companies abused the system one of whom which already stopped prescribing controlled substances months and months ago the dea is ignoring the law congress ordered them years ago to allow telemedicine prescriptions of controlled substances but they been ignoring itcan we please stop hurting people who desperately need these drugs to function for the sake of addicts i m not saying those who abuse drugs should just die they should get the help they need too but they aren t more important than people who need the drugs to functionwe do need new rules just need to enforce the ones we already have there certainly other ways to solve this problem that will cause less harmmalpractice is still a thing lawsuits for overprescribing is still a thing this is going to hurt more than it helps let professionals do their jobwhat a damn bastard more hurdles for people with legitimate medical needs just what they needwhat i hearing government wants to make it even harder for you to make decisions for yourself by reducing the number of people you can hire to make them for you let people buy what they want just make sure they have access to the information about it so we have informed consent if a few of them make stupid choices and die that on themso the cost of my families health insurance is already insane we still have to clear the deductible before we re no longer paying out of pocket during peak covid i was gifted the choice by my doctor to make the 40 min drive west orlando traffic or have the appointment via a video call music to my families ears since that gas expense could now go towards something else now the medication i m prescribed for my attention span until recently vyvance was over 200 with health insurance is going to require me to make that long ass drive all over again tl dr if you re going to make us jump thru hoops to get our doctor prescribed meds filled instead of focusing on the root cause of the problem strict doctors nurse practitioners and a much more competent fluid health care system at least make the shitty ass insurance cheaper for usi sure it has to do with quality healthcare and certainly not to do with medical facilities health insurance companies and prescription drug manufacturers working together to milk event cent they can out of the publicas someone with adhd and who is of severe complications or yanno death from covid19 telehealth prescriptions have been a godsend not only does telehealth protect my health it saves my ass from my own time blindness much easier to have an alarm set for 5 minutes before the appointment to go to the web page and be ready versus risking being late to an appointment its already hoop after hoop after hoop to find a provider who will actually treat adhd in adults to the point i ca even seriously consider moving because i genuinely do know how or when i will have access to my medication the pervasive belief that adults do have adhd is a massive issuei sure no states will put birth control and abortion meds on that listso in the middle of a healthcare crisis where nobody can be fucking seen because there are no god damn doctorsso is this government going to make all of our medical decisions for usi wonder if this is another way to try to block women from accessing misoprostil andseems like this is basically a way to cut back on telehealth doctors operating as pill millstake away my baby lets gooooooo i ready for the episode that been suppressed for yearsvpn and a friends address i know people that do that to get glasses contacts to replace ones that are a good working prescription if your ip is in nc 1800contacts will do a online exam but if you are in sc they will notpatients will need to see a doctor in person at least once to get an initial prescription for drugs one time is a deal breakerit takes months to get an appointment with my doctor for anxiety medication this will not help there is an waiting time for my primary care physician alone not even my psychiatrist seriously the biden administration should go f itselfit sounds like a good idea but i do see how this will change anythingmdos are over prescribing these drugs it is killing people and it is compounding issues with shortages the issues need to be addressedand this is why i use kratomthis just makes my life harderi think this is a good idea if you not being referred by your family doctor the initial consultation should be in person your identity needs to be verified and physical examinations should probably be performed after that telemedicine is fineworst idea ever just let people get anti biotic alreadyhfs up until now you could literally call someone on the phone and get aderall oxy and vicodin what did even i bother getting

never heard about thisi got to my first duty station in wurzbug germany about an hour away only a few weeks after this happened there were flyers all over the bases asking for information it blew my mind because as a fresh private at only 18 years old i didn t realize that there were crimes being committed just like the civilian world i hope this guy rots if he s guiltytragic make sure the killers answers for thiswill he be tried in military court since he was in the army then will germany also request for him to be extradited since the crime was on german soil genuinely curious though

vodkahttpswho can really explain why they support the usa being in the ukrainenanrichard ward was the unarmed man fatally executed by police https in front of his mother in a school parking lot for taking an anti anxiety pill in colorado the police officer that fired 3 shots at point blank range into his chest was given a purple heartcops are allowed to use lethal force if they feel the least bit threatened but if an untrained civilian is suddenly yanked out of a car and thrown to the ground by an officer the slightest resistance is ground for a summary execution the thug who murdered richard ward wo face justice and there wo be any protests but the video was one of the most heinous police murders i seenthey know what they doing and they rubbing it in your facethe purple heart is just a military award or are they admitting the police are a military branch designed to control the populationthat poor family i cant imagine losing someone like that and not only is the person that did the killing free to go about their life but also rewarded for itwe must eviscerate police unions nationwide they re a blight on our society and must not be allowed to exist qualified immunity and these das that won t prosecute all have to go as well we can fix this in a month if we had a president who had some ballsreminds me of how those officers that gave that child back to dahmer basically got promoted for being racist pigs thank the union thoughwtf is this reality this sounds like the most absurd dystopian authoritarian double speak shit i have ever heard a police officer gets a purple heart for injuring himself while shooting and killing an unarmed and compliant man this is essentially spitting in the face of all the officers who actually earned a purple heart for being injured while protecting and serving their community what a disgracei will 100 never call the cops for any reason for myself or others if i am ever in an interaction with a cop my goal will be to safely defuse the situation as quickly as possible and get myself and my family out of there alive and unharmed why send a trigger happy schoolyard bully with a gun and a license to kill anywhere at all you are playing with fire they could just murder you or anyone else and give themselves an award for it i would call gangs either not that i know any for the same reasonas a native puebloan this shit sickens me cops in pueblo have always been like this the entire department is made up of people i went to high school with who are the absolute last types of people who should be able to wield lethal force thee strangest most disturbed collection of individuals one could imagine i left at twenty and have never looked back this is terrible just entirely unnecessary and disgustingpolice given awards for murdering in cold blood fuck all copsi wan na know how the karen that called the cops on him for accidentally trying to open the door to the wrong car feels also the video i saw of the incident was so fucking pathetic as soon as he takes the pill the officer grabs him by his clothing and violently yanks him out of the car on to the ground and then it looks like in the struggle while they rolling around and this guy having a panic attack the officer feels something that makes him think ward was trying to get his gun so of course he panics as well officer dipshit feared for his life because he was carrying a service weapon and put himself in a dangerous situation not because ward posed any real threat he engaged with him in the most dangerous way possible instead of asking him to exit the vehicle with hands up started a fight so he could physically harm ward i hope with all my heart that officer fears become reality one day in front of his family the way he likes itthe people will rise against its oppressors eventuallysince when do we give military commendations to copsthat little bitch got a purple heart for giving himself a bloody nose while attacking and murdering an innocent man this is america we need to stop thismcwhorter was transported to parkview hospital after the incident according to the report actually stood there watching the unarmed person he shot die not helping due to safety concerns like maybe people upset he had just killed an unarmed person in front of his mother and kid brother and this fucking murderous pig got a ride to the hospital for some fucking scratches and back and neck pain seems reasonable and equitable to medisgusting he deserves jail time not an awardthis is dystopian to the extent that i thought it was satire boggle the mind a simple confusion on where i parked my car could trigger a karen initiating a police execution this is not good advertisement for tourism to the usai mean what else can we do the system has pushed people into a corner either accept that a cop can murder you at anytime for no reason for little to no consequence or become a criminal commit violence against the police and watch the public embrace the police even more time after time it has been shown that if we try to elect politicians to reform the police the police intimidate and coerce their way out of it i do know what to do we fight the cops we accept that cops can free kill us both options seem doomedcops get purple heart medals jesus these fucks are larpersthe purple heart is a united states military decoration awarded in the name of the president to those wounded or killed while serving this would be funny if this gang in blue is such a menace to innocent citizenshow much fear do you have to have to shoot an unarmed man that is not a threat to you totally bitch boy movejust another reason why i never trust a cop dirty bastardstheir just making up their own awards nowjesus this is disgustinga metal for killing an unarmed civilian for no reason fuck this country man i so tiredholy fuck colorado cops are sadistic deranged psychopathshe also being sued by his victim family over the same incidentits like anyone can give out military medals now he should get some ribbons added to the purple heart for the order of the brown and yellow trousers and maybe an extra red ribbon for the murder of an innocent citizentil that cops get purple hearts and medal of valor they really are at war with the american publici genuinely afraid of copspolice unions add so much insult to so many injuriespolice are there to protect they are there to enforcethis must be the onion this must be the onion this must be the onion this must be the onionso a deputy gets a military medal for unnecessarily shooting and killing a man in a school parking lot and then accidentally shooting himself this country is fuckedcops protect and serve cops the rest of us are expendable at best and worthless vermin at worst this is reflected in the training and actions of departments across the country over decades anyone who tells you differently is selling you a child s fantasyjesus who detective chinssss to the leftat some point one of these family members is going to go on a vengeance spree and i won t be able to entirely condemn themthis heroic officer deserves a literal purple heart i not talking about the medalbeing a police officer is not even in the top 10 most dangerous occupations in terms of further at least 50 of cop injuries are from motor vehicle accidents of the other 50 there is a wide variety of causes including slip falls it almost never happens that a cop is shot by a bad guy the rate is much higher than civilians getting shot by bad guys and by far the most common scenario is domestic violence calls cops can prepare for those the union uses is vast resources to fund a huge national machine of lobbyists and lawyers who aggressively curate an environment of a departmental policy based on training and shoot first ask questions later mentality b collective bargaining agreements making it extremely difficult to fire a bad apple and c a combination of both actual statutory immunity and qualified immunity in all cases the root of the problem is public unions which ought to be illegaland all the pigs are enjoying their circle jerk where are all the good cops demanding action be taken away from these guys nah they ll defend each other to the death of othersthat just plain sickall police departments are nazi paramilitary organizations that s why their attitude is so confusing to people who aren t educated on such groupsward appeared to put a pill in his mouth and then mcwhorter pulled him out of the rear passenger seat of the vehicle a brief physical altercation ensued mcwhorter and other responding officers claimed in his interview with the cit that he thought ward was reaching for his gun the gun ward had holstered in his mouthall cops are bastards there only less than 700k officers in the us and tens of millions that hate their guts too bad americans do have a fraction of the nerve europeans haveit like police departments want more of these things to happen and do these kind of things to try and aggravate the local populace so they can identify and brutalized anyone who disagrees with this psychopathic type of behaviornot only a murdering piece of shit but also stolen valor by claiming the shit they do is akin to the militarythis is absolutely rage and vomit inducinghow is that pig not in jail awaiting trial for murder this country is severely derangedunless every pueblo officer is boasting numerous purple hearts for their many noses and bruised knees throughout their service it hard to see how this is anything more than a fuck you to the publicin my country we do call 911 for a junkie making a mistake and trying to get into your car nor do we call cops for other things done by the mentally something is seriously rotten in the soul of middle class america me and my own interest above alloverreacting to the point of murder seems to be a pattern for this asshole mcwhorter also received the medal of valor award in 2018 because of his response during a 2017 shooting in colorado city mcwhorter and deputy charles roldan were responding to a search for dennis flowers who had an arrest warrant out for a robbery flowers allegedly pointed a gun at mcwhorter according to the cit report for the incident roldan first shot flowers twice and then mcwhorter shot the man 10 times until flowers fell to the grounddon t you usually get an award like that for killing enemies in war timethis person deserves a fate equal to damiensi just gon na name something the heart and give it to someone it be exactly like the militaryshould have beennansounds like they missed all vital organs naked gun joke so she is going to be ok was released a day later probably an accident but since it appears it was a felon who did it back to jail he goi had a gun once it was when i was in the army they kept the gun locked up in the armory guess they cared about their investmentthis is why we need actual courses training and certification required for firearms owners that way only the people who care enough about safety and responsibility would would be willing to go through the hoops to get a gun you get caught with a gun and you should have one jailtime at the minimum there will always be people who skirt the system and get one illicitly so we should remove the option for safe responsible gun owners to have one as welli thought guns don t hurt peoplewas the shooting related to him being a councilman if not why even mention him like her epitaph will just be proud councilmombut why would she shoot through her own doorthe title is worded very well did the mother shoot at something else through her door or was she shot by somebody else through her doordfw is a dangerous areathat some writing right there sheeshnanlet my boy go free he

glad someone explained that to memaybe republicans should stop cutting taxes on the wealthiest they keep doing that than acting shocked when the government does have money so they demand dems cut social problems but whatever happens the next time republicans come i to power they gon na cut the taxes on the wealthiest againoh nice my bank is currently giving out 300 if i refer someone to take out a new loan anyone know the email of the treasury department so i can send them my linktoward is misleading treasury department paid record amount in interest on the national debt this payment took away from other budget items and amounts to more national debt this is a bad thing not a good thingmeanwhile our government is handing our huge checks to businesses for the employee retention credit mostly for fraudulent claimsborrowing more money than we ever have before at historically high interest rates will tend to do that this is news to anyone who has been vaguely paying attentionmake the rich pay their tax the rich tax the and put a windfall tax on companies that made insane amounts of during the ronaduh debt gets bigger interest on said debt gets bigger too gdp grows every year as well no problem paying the debt as long as republicans do block raising the debt ceilingwhere is rich dad poor dadthat s what happens though the debt goes up the amount of interest paid goes up we have record amounts of debt so one stands tobe minting that trillion dollar coin any day nowand that why i cashed in my shitty savings bonds getting 1 and switched them to ibonds getting 7 with the new ratespeople working for a living supporting an effete aristocracydoes the interest rise every year so would this statement always be true i mean unless we paid down the principal but we never do somoney printer go brrrrr till all the scwry creditors go homethat 2017 gop tax cut is playing out exactly like every sane person warnedeli5 please who is the government paying interest tothe hike is mainly due to the federal reserve raising interest rates this is an incredibly deceptive statement the federal reserve printed five trillion dollars in the span of two years remember how everyone was locked down during covid that did come for free it was enabled by printing trillions of dollars https turns out that when you print five trillion dollars you get inflation incredible how that works who could seen that coming now the fed is pushing interest rates higher and higher and higher to reduce inflation hence the united states is paying more on it debt right now long term treasuries are yielding about 4 and two years ago they were payingcut taxes balance the budget grow the economy republicans never tire uttering nonsensecbs joins with the rest of the media trying to demonize biden and democrats for the massive debt increase that trump and republicans createdmaybe it time the government tried to cut spendingrepublicans record interest payments so farooo you know what fix this problem abolish the irsso who did we pay the interest to the federal reserve bank owned by a couple if private bankers including jpmorganchasecan t they make up any interest rate they wantit s imaginary money the government debt and interest doesn t matter who in the world will go against the might usd let s increase the budget give everyone universal income there hasn t been any bad things happpen ever time we increase the debt also if you decrease the debt you will be firing so many government workersi think we should not pay does china own some of it if they are siding with russia and denying spy balloons and propaganda i wan na see them collect on our defaultare we owning the libs yeti no financial genius but considering our debt only goes up ca you literally just this headline ever yearso who again are we actually payingjust start auctioning off historical artifacts like the original copy of the constitution or the declaration of independence i pay good money for lincoln tophati think you have that wrong taxpayers paid record amount of interest paymentsbecause there is record debt we d all like to thank the rocket scientist for their hard work and determination to notify the public of their findingsnanokay so i pretty sure that kaiser permanente is saying that chloe cole is lying like confidence kp said in their statement that their treatments meet all medical standards given that chloe cole is 18 now that means that we talking 5 years ago at the earliest and that means she was treated under wpath standards of care version 7 https wpath sets worldwide treatment guidelines for trans people of all ages unless kp is flatly lying in their statement their treatment must have conformed to wpath soc7 soc8 is up now and its guidelines are different but that only came out in september of 2022 long after cole had become an activist so what does wpath soc7 say about when kids should be treated and in what way two goals justify intervention with puberty suppressing hormones i their use gives adolescents more time to explore their gender nonconformity and other developmental issues and ii their use may facilitate transition by preventing the development of sex characteristics that are difficult or impossible to reverse if adolescents continue on to pursue sex reassignment puberty suppression may continue for a few years at which time a decision is made to either discontinue all hormone therapy or transition to a hormone regimen pubertal suppression does not inevitably lead to social transition or to sex reassignment in other words soc7 emphasized puberty blockers with the aim of stopping puberty until a teen was old enough to make abstract decisions on their own at that point they would be eligible for hrt blockers were and still are almost always used to delay until a teen was before any further medical intervention adolescents may be eligible to begin hormone therapy preferably with parental consent in many countries are legal adults for medical and do not require parental consent ideally treatment decisions should be made among the adolescent the family and the treatment team in other words soc7 emphasized making a decision on hrt between a patient their parents and the care team any one of the three could veto it genital surgery should not be carried out until i patients reach the legal age of majority in a given country and ii patients have lived continuously for at least 12 months in the gender role that is congruent with their gender identity the age threshold should be seen as a minimum criterion and not an indication in and of itself for active intervention chest surgery in ftm patients could be carried out earlier preferably after ample time of living in the desired gender role and after one year of testosterone treatment the intent of this suggested sequence is to give adolescents sufficient opportunity to experience and socially adjust in a more masculine gender role before undergoing irreversible surgery in other words only rarely should transmasculine top surgery occur before the age of majority and only after ample time living as their gender moreover this was the only surgery wpath soc7 said should ever happen on a minor for both hrt and transmasculine top surgery soc7 requires the capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent for treatment in other words a care team can not offer either treatment under soc7 until and unless a child can make informed consent hrt first then top surgery it is not possible for chloe cole to have met these standards and begun testosterone at 13 kp is bound by hipaa if she lying they ca just say no she started testosterone at age outside of a courtroom either kp is lying in saying that chloe cole was treated under standard of care or chloe cole is lying given the press tour cole has been on for over a year now i know which i would suspect to be true mark my words i bet just about anything cole withdraws the lawsuit a few days before it moves to discoverythe fact she s not also suing her parents tells me all i need to knowis that the noted conservative activistthis is the latest gop battle in the culture war designed to rile up primary voters there are only a few gender assignment reversals done annually in the whole country most patients say surgery has saved their life kaiser makes no money on this surgery everything is paid from their own internal insurance group httpsharmeet dhillon now where have i heard that name before oh now i remember https also as a victim of kaiser in the past you literally need to threaten a lawsuit to get them to perform surgery on you and even then most times they will laugh in your face and say bring it for this patient to receive this procedure i am betting the parents hounded the staff to the depths of hell i would go healthcare if kaiser was the only choice so i know this may sound harshi sorry she suing the health insurance company because she regrets transitioning am i missing something hereit needs to be screamed from the rooftops that the detransition rate is somewhere between according to dozens of reputable studies to deny all trans teen hormones to spare 5 an incorrect transition is akin to saying i would rather 95 trans teens commit suicide if it meant 5 cis teens would survive or in short the value of a trans life is valued as 20x less important than a cis life if a trans life is equal to a cis life than we should be doing what helps the most amount of peoplemy son transitioned with the kaiser gender pathways and a a mom i can say thank goodness for kaiserany trans person can attest to how fucking hard it is to actually get to the surgery stage of things even if you ve got the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars depending on the procedure there s absolutely no one pushing surgery you have to fight for it anyone speaking to the contrary is either disingenuous or delusionali not sure i happy with kids getting irreversible surgery done to them i thought the point of puberty blockers was that they could just take them and then once they are an adult they can get surgery and other hormones transgender surgery performed on her when she was 13as a background to the entire issue of sex change procedures i recommend this account from a queer former case manager at a us transgender center httpsremovedremovedcalling it now this is going all the way to the supreme courtthey want this to go to the supreme court it all intentionalnanyou had to be pretty nuts to have been donating to them in the first placethe taliban are cancer the afghan people need to kill itgood fuck the taliban backwards bigoted savagesit reminds me of north korea the people are starving and the leadership spends the money not on food but on weapons to threaten their neighbors should the neighbors enable this by providing food to the starving people the taliban made the decision that they would rather their kids starve than let them be fed by a woman who wo cover her head should we enable their behaviorinstead arguing for western countries to find a liminal space between pariah and legitimate status to respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis the taliban just banned birth control of any kind which means birth rates will go up in a country already plagued by hunger sorry but western countries ca bail them out with this their government is just making things worse and when that happens all you can do is wait for people to destroy the government or for the government to collapse reminds me of countries aiding brutal dictatorships in africa with aid which only helped them stay in power or giving humanitarian aid to north korea which they used to feed their army rather than your average person systems like this need to be allowed to fail even if it causes great suffering propping them up does solve any problems aid should be reserved for unexpected disasters like say the turkey earthquakeseverything donated goes to the talibandelighted to hear it to give donations to men who wish to relegate their women back to the status of being worthless chattels and slaves is a waste of resourcesi not saying it would ever be justified to withhold humanitarian assistance to anyone even the taliban i am saying that we free to set the priorities for the finite assistance that exists i see no reason to put afghanistan high on that listlet them pray for manna from their sky buddy who supposedly loves them most bit let no human raise a finger or send a penny to support them let the parents of starving babies hunt and eat the talibanthere are other wealthy islamic nations that can help them not sure this is our problem anymoreit a shit dilemma the last time the only one to help them was bin laden they do it to themselves i get that but damnthe taliban will just switch from accepting donations to demanding them nothing will changethey preach that allah is all you need so get him to help you i ll wait the first time atheism became something it was after a tsunami and earthquake in portugal they all went to the church for safety and it collapsed and killed a lot of people maybe that s what needs to happen in afghanistan for people to open their eyes and throw out religious theocratsa lot of people in this thread seem to be under the impression that the headline is talking about donations the it talking about donors to ngo humanitarian efforts directed at the afghani people the civilian population suffering under the taliban ruleoh course the taliban has established a theocracy and are no longer bleeding the us of resources so why on earth would the saudis still want to support them i think it is so funny the us has spent 20 years fighting against terrorists all of which just happened to have been equipped and paid by the same saudi princes the us would turn around and ass kiss in exchange for a little cheap oilthese people are all crazy women

follow the case yet are wrong so confidentlyrittenhouse probably has the least money of everyone being suedlawyers gon na litigatehaving lived in wisconsin and the midwest suing people is a fairly useless and fruitless endeavor in wisconsin with minnesota taking the crown for making it fuck near impossible to collect wisconsin is that much better and the reality is is that they likely never see a dime from rittenhouse they can keep the debt alive by renewing it in court every 7 years but if he out of state it is going to do much also wisconsin courts generally do refer debts to credit bureaus and only sell fines and court costs to debt collectors while possible with civil debt if the owners push it it extremely uncommon for a civilian to impact a debtors credit and usually only happens if they sell the debt to a debt collector who may opt to just write it off if they deem it too much of a hassle assuming they did just outright reject the debt tl dr they probably wasting their time trying to sue him in civil court in a state and region known for being hostile towards anyone that tries to bring civil debts and situations before a judge edit https federal judge but a

coming up with lies to keep his domestic audience in checksounds like an invitationno no no enough of the ruzzian these ruzzian peacekeepers need to be shown the exit right now they been there too long already wtfwe should just let them stay mad and moldova itthey super serious this timethe west warns russia that russian warnings are ignored nownanat this point does it matter anymore if the officers ca definitively say yes he was armed and posed a serious threat does that just mean they shot a guy who was running away with a pair of sunglasses if they have to work this hard to prove a suspect was armed after the fact i would trust if they did find somethingdid we start shooting shopliftersfairfax county police chief says it not yet known whether a shoplifting suspect who was shot and killed wednesday night after a foot chase outside of tysons corner center was armed and an investigation is ongoing that seems pretty easy to determine check his body check the route he took to where the cops shot him check where he got shot if there no weapon he probably got fucking murdered by a cop over some sunglassestypical police press release with the sub headline right under the title at the top being the second thing you read timothy mccree johnson of washington had a significant violent criminal history police say i very much doubt they knew that when they killed him so they re just attempting to paint a portrait of justification for the murder by basically saying oh he was a pos anyways nothing to see hereuh one might think you want to establish that before using deadly force on themwe need to take the cops guns away like they a child who failed a test until they prove they can be trusted we taking your toys away you want to act like children we treat you like oneso if it s unknown it means that he didn t have a weapon on him when they shot him and are going to pretend like he might have had a weapon on him that he ditched during the chasedavis said the suspect identified thursday as timothy mccree johnson 37 of washington had a significant violent criminal which they did not know when they shot himone less violent criminalconfirmed he was unarmedtranslation they weren twhen society values objects more than human life it doomeddeleteddamn an armless shoplifter how does a five finger discount work in that situationunknown more like waiting to see what they can prove in a court room when will this endiow he was unarmedif you do know then the answer is probably noif he was armed they would have immediately said that in the press release to absolve any responsibility related to using deadly force to claim it s unknown gives the police department plausible deniabilty and establishes that there is a when in fact they likely killed an innocent person because their officer s are incompetent cruel a pr stunt essentially it s bullshit they are trying to not get sued for killing someone running away from them after stealing under 100 of stuff from a grocery store which btw isn t even a felony gunned down by the psycho trigger happy legalized gang let s see how the city officials defend themand if there is body cam video from the officers that clearly shows a weapon then we should all assume that the officers are lying because they will do anything and everything to cover for each other including filing false reports and lying under oath their track record demonstrably proves that police as a whole no longer deserve the benefit of the doubtwhere are the pro life people at this once upon a time was just shot for stealing checks notes a pair of sunglassesso that do know if he had a gun or knife but they know he had a significant violent criminal maybe they should work the scene and determine that before they go looking for any little shred of excuse that shooting someone for stealing a pair of sunglasses would be justifiedthen you say unarmed pretty simplei not buying it if there was a gun you know it would be up on the front page of the local paper copaganda piece is what it isthey lying to us time to disband that police departmenteither a guy is clearing out a store with a garbage bag unopposed or armed response is smoking people no in betweenwas the mall dead or something tyson corner center gets pretty packed in the afternoons and on weekends seems pretty fucking dangerousinvestigating the area for surveillance cameras so they can figure out if it safe to pull a baltimore pd https and plant one somewhere back in the day they do it automatically but these days you got ta be more carefuldo worry based on virginia police history the shooting cop will be suspended with pay he be given cop of the year and retire with full pension source my unarmed best friend was shot in the back of the head by a virginia police officer cop got cop of the year later in his career and got to retire i sure the bootlickers will want to know what my friend did wrong but fuck indulging them in even more detailsover sunglasses wow it gets worse by the dayno weapon and another police man hunt and kill again is anyone keeping national statistics on thesei m sure the police will find a weapon on himso cops are just stupid either they found a gun on him or not if he had a gun he is armed no gun unarmed maybe the police can learn some new wordsthey didn t find anything after looking is what they meanfairfax county police are investigating the shooting and killing of a suspected shoplifter after a foot chase outside of tysons corner center it is unknown whether the suspect was armed and both officers fired their weapons with the suspect being struck an unknown number of times the suspect was taken to the hospital but died shortly after and the two officers involved are on administrative leave as the investigation continues fairfax county police chief kevin davis stated that the suspect had a significant violent criminal history and body camera footage of the incident will be released in 30 days in accordance with county policy summary generated by chatgpt tysons corner center is located in tysons va approximately 15 minutes west of the national malli thought the democrats were gon na do something about the police in america we need federal laws getting rid of qualified immunity the police shouldn t be able to shoot anyone they wantit s pretty obvious he wasn t actually armed now he could ve appeared armed or he could ve tried to fight grab their weapon etc that would warrant a shooting as someone around the area i hope this doesn t turn into another messsuspect was fleeing therefore posed no threat to the officers or the public at largei thought the democrats were gon na do something about the police in america we need federal laws getting rid of qualified immunity the police shouldn t be able to shoot anyone they wanti sick of police shooting innocent people but i also sick of shoplifters and the malls being ruined by thefts and criminalswho cares if he was armed don t fight or flee from the cops and this doesn t happen better yet don t steali feed my chickens chickennanit been more than expected just about every month i just saw an article about how people are buying less stuff because they are budgeting more for food costsi love how every article lays the blame squarely at the feet of consumers for having the audacity to actually purchase things like how dare we make money or spend moneya lot of talk about the spiral not much talk about the profit spiral we still doing buybacks we re still doing buybacksyou can almost feel shit about to hit the fan increasing layoffs in various sectors on top of increasing prices on just about everything hold on to your buttsinflation or price gougingi love economics because it s pseudoscience why are we acting like oh a increase more than expected blah blah blah as if inflation is some sort of force of nature companies need infinite growth from a finite planet so the only alternative is to just keep raising prices therefore you ve increased ur profit in a way that looks nice on a stock chart but is not based in material realitywe can blame corporate gouging and all we want but corporations are always trying to maximize profit they did just wake up during covid and think oh wow think we charge more for our products and services now this is a culmination of years and years of pumping money into the economy and basement rates especially during the covid crisis in my opinion that was needed to stop the covid pandemic from turning into a financial crisis however just take a look at the m1 and m2 money supplies we are now just coming off of the peak but still way way above where we were prior to https https throw in supply shocks and bottlenecks and we still experiencing inflationinflation reduction act was supposed to reduce inflation i thoughtof course prices keep going up because the large corporations can do it without having to answer to anybody it s not like people can just opt to not buy most don t have the means to procure it in other ways and they are working more hours for the same spending power they had years ago even if their wages are technically higher perhaps riots with pitchforks and torches are in fact the only way to deal with these companiesif anyone tries to tell you that 600 stimulus you got is the reason for inflation or even the ppp that got abused it was the fed has been printing trillions a year literally giving it to them for free for banks in the form of reverse repo operations since at least httpskeep trying to tell people this is over that it beyond the ukraine war climate change and biosphere collapse impacts are upon us with impacts to our food supply and people are fed up with corporate rule and greed but nope people still want to pretend all is normal again after the pandemic sorry folks we are just one major breadbasket failure from utter collapse of global financial markets and the us congress president and fed are impotent to do anything but protect the rich as are most nationsthey should stop calling it inflation and call it corporate profit growththe game is rigged markets move based on how expectations are met easy to manipulate also very easy to see that markets will go back up next week based on the chartsi think its higher we went food shopping yesterday and the apples were they are never that high and it was a cheaper supermarketno bailouts for corporationsand yet here are house republicans pushing nonsense like hunter s laptop committee and calling for a seditious national divorce pepperidge farm remembers their campaign bullshitcorporate greed rose bymuch of january s inflation surge came from a 2 rise in energy prices according to friday s report food prices increased goods and services both rose on an annual basis food prices rose while energy was up this is just continued price gouging by oil companies nothing more nothing less oil prices affect the price of all other goods that require shipping and transportation virtually everything these dayshas it been per month for a few months it seems like it if i had thought about it i would have expected in january i go out on a limb i expect it to rise in february 2023nanaccording to mertz the newest estimates show that roughly small fish were potentially killed as a result of the derailment as well as an additional other species of fish amphibians and other creatures for the people who wo read the articlewhew thank goodness we not animalsthey seriously do care that people will die you think they care about some random animalsso it kills the animals but is somehow ok for peopleyeah okay but those animals were even making trillions of dollars of profit so who gives a shithow did we let ourselves come to a place where corporations can give money to politicians who then vote for laws in favor of the corporations who gave them money those laws then lead to a lack of regulations regarding hazardous waste handling and train operations which then lead to the annihilation of of the entire fucking ecosystem of an animal population that has been here way before any of our ancestors were how did it come to this all to increase norfolk southern s profits by 2 we as a species are doing such profound and lasting damage to our planet with chemicals that we know very little about regarding long term effects to organic life corporations are literally poisoning us for profit dupont knew about pfoa polyfluorooctanoic acid and more broadly pfas since the 1970s and still chose to directly release it into public waterways in the 1970s we still ingest pfas through our scratched cookware when dupont was studying pfas in the 1970s and tried to find a sample of clean blood in the general they couldn t they had to go to the national archives and get blood samples of korean war soldiers to get a control sample blood free of pfas think about that and this stuff is really bad we re talking all sorts of cancer autoimmune disorders birth defects i could go on just google superfund sites and look at how many hazardous waste spills there have been and those are just the federally documented ones then look up the groundwater testing results from the epa or state agency for that particular cleanup project most of them result in conditional closures meaning that the regulatory agencies literally leave the chemicals in the ground and put a cap usually a parking lot or building on top of it not to mention all the military sites that have been poisoning us with pfas firefighting chemicals yep even the government has been doing it for decades and they ve been one of the worst perpetrators this train just scratches the surface of what we ve done to this planet all because of human stupidity and corporate greed something needs to change because this is really fucked uphere i am transporting lady bugs from being trapped in a window screen meanwhile the majority of the world could care less about any life but their own it s depressing being empathetic in an increasingly cold and uncaring populacethey aerosolized deadly forever chemicals will be when enough organisms to form a stable ecosystem evolve to ignore the crap that now permanently in the soil and water tableohio needs to class action sue the state or something their home values are gone they can t escape and they need to gtfo of there asap and this was a direct result of their gov and other hacks getting paid to deregulate by corporationsthe time frame will be a lifetimethey re destroying this country our heartland the farms and crops every politician and corporation should be held accountable43k dead animals yet safe in every way for human inhabitants riiiiiiighti feel so exhauseted from all this these fucks do not care and they will get away with it regardless of a fine they may or may not pay rich fuckers wo experience the fall out i am convinced they are incapable of caring about anything that is not enriching themselvesthe whole article is about fish where is the impact on land animals like livestock and petsbut they said there not a problemrussia can keep their nukes we too busy rendering our own homeland unliveable for indeterminate amounts of timethese disasters destroy ecosystems for decades they also destroy people livelihoods we can not let this slide we have to fight to keep this in the news and put pressure on norfolk southernwhat interesting to me is a eden based branch of christianity never developed like in their holy book god placed great value on nature and said that they should take care of nature why do we have thatbut the water is fine according to coke bottle glasses idiot dewinecanaries coal mines shut up and get back to workbankrupt that companystop voting republican you can still harbor hate in your heart for minorities and lgtbq but do vote for dirty air and water at the bare minimum your bigoted ass does need to get us all poisoned by greedy slobsthey still digging desperately to find and count all the trapped and presumed dead moles this is a comment on the weirdly specific numberthat is sad and all but the important question is how does this affect proftisas in the ecosystem that was here will never recover because they are all dead and we have no replacement take a close look at the watershed and how much of that gets used on crop land they poisoned a major part of the center of our country and are currently getting away with literal ecocidei still am in disbelief that in 2023 somebody decided to set a train loaded to the gills with toxic chemicals on fire on purpose i unsurprised it was done solely to get the tracks cleared so the money making trains could keep running but still you think that mass poisoning the environment on purpose would be off the tablewater under the bridge oh wait that the problemonly in ohio this meme is now probably offensiveso when do we start taking matters into our own hands since our elected officials are complicit when is enough enoughthis is good from a natural selection standpoint if you wildlife can not withstand our toxic chemicals you do deserve to livelmk when they find the grass man deadanimals all dead but people all good for nowhydrogen chloride and phosgene gas are perfectly safe bastardsso dewine and other government officials must be drunken to assure that water and everything else is just fineif you think the animal numbers are bad wait until we see the human numbers start to happenseems odd that the ohio governor is turning down whatever help the federal government is offeringif it killing the fish then it in the groundwater and will start killing human beings if it killing the birds it in the air and will start killing human beings this is a tier 1 highest level biocontamination event and so many will sufferthis is so devastating this could of been preventedand you have trump blaming biden for this making the rounds there but he the one who rolled back the protections from train derailment for small communities to help businesses it really too bad they buy the rhetoric there is no bottom for these kind of politiciansprobably increased cancer rates and infant mortality defects for the next 50 years or so at least it s like an american version of fallujahits ok trump gave them a pallet of water and baked beansrepublicans once again murdering people and animalsdon t worry trump is bringing water and some hats made in china to make up for the damage his deregulation is responsible forgot ta be honest that an incredibly low figure it has to be lower than reality it also not just the animals killed but also the animals not born due to the generations before it not survivingtrying to stop avian flu on its tracksi think we about to have a politician or two get really sick i personally would not trust the water therethis has to be a super low ball countso i m construction if we kill any protect species we get fucked so time to fuck norfolk if just 1 protective species diedepa it safe nothing to see herei saw some politicians drinking tap water so it must all be oki like to thank presidents obama trump and biden for making all of this possiblei guess i m the only person who cares these right wing fools are destroying our country it s not just climate change its country change they just do not care about anythingwe kill trillions of animals every year for fun a couple thousand do make much difference38000 were small fish most of them were minnowsand trillions for nonhuman animal products yearly and countless in slavery and nonhuman animal testing but we don t see that on the news and both are caused by humans being heartless and mindless 1 we re animals too it s basic biology 2 officials don t be hypocritesi wonder what the frogs will turn intoyour government doesn t care america too busy giving billions away to other countries and supplying your great and awesome war machinescientists told me not to worry about the chemicals just as deadly as an open gas stove this must be fake news cause i trust the scienceat least all the people were safely one whole american mile away from dangerthe small fish never had a chance to be big fishwhy has the entire area not been evacuated of peoplewhat is to recover everything is finewait look in the sky it a ufojesus christ my brain actually thought this train was carrying animals i was fully willing to accept for several seconds that this was effectively noahs ark on wheels like we lived in the same reality as snowpiecerthis is america chernobyl

a convictionremovedso how is he getting jail time but someone like bill cosby was set freenanunless i missed it the article doesn t say what the increase was just that it was the largest in 2 decadesquite a contrast with us companies fighting tooth and nail against giving decent wage to its workers and they bitch and moan why they have problems attracting workersi worked for a join venture which was managed by toyota toyota really is a great company to be an auto workeri think it notable the word hike was chosen here instead of increasedoes this mean the qc will improve on vehicles like the new tundra have you driven one or seen the reviews i could believe toyota put their name on that failsounds good but they probably only raised them up to just barely get by for another 20yearsthis is why the new stupid buys a non union tesla shitboxit a trap ackbar endor 1983a big wage hike in two decades is a normalisationtoyota came here and is building really great stuff it s proof that the american executives were the problem not the workers even mercedes is building good stuff here and mercedes has overall very bad managementtoyota is the biggest employer in my state their plant is not union and it was celebrated as non union because union i bet the rank will rethink their option nowof course they did because they the world best companygood for those workers unfortunately toyota incompetent management is hell bent on turning toyota into the next kodak so we will see how long it lastsmaybe they can use some of that money they promised not to donate to insurrectionist republican politicians oh wait they lied about thatjust means toyota will raise prices even more and hide things behind subscriptions but the price hikes will be even higher than the 5 wage increase and every extra penny will go straight into the pockets of executivestrickle down inflationi thought toyota did have unions and that is why toyotas are so high quality is this a japan thingbiggest wage hike sure but wont this lead to future layoffs to compensatenanburkina faso disputed zone who called all these weird placesnana story about mali from one of my coworkers his father was an american citizen of malian descent and would go there often because he was an agricultural expert he was kidnapped by rebels however the rebels panicked and released him when they found out he was american the reason was they couldn t ransom him to the mali government because the mali government would just kill his father and say the rebels did it that way the mali government could get more support from the usa to fight the rebels purely anecdotal but that s the story i was toldnani be more amazed if there was a single one that was horrifically crueli do understand why people do realize that the entire meat industry is predicated on suffering and abject cruelty profit comes above all else pigs are born into horrific conditions bred until they killed or their uteruses prolapse females spend their entire lives in tiny crates unable to move to turn around going insane from these conditions others get to live in cramped and barren pens with no access to sunlight or fresh air they abused and beaten by workers and allowed to suffer with open wounds and infections if cattle are lucky they get to spend time on pasture but dairy cattle are confined to disgusting lots standing in their own piss and shit and allowed to suffer with laminitis from diets and poultry are on level with pigs for the torturous conditions they experience there is nothing remotely humane about the meat industryit a slaughterhouse there hardly a slaughterhouse that is deeply crueli do think anyone is aware that a slaughterhouse is not kind to animals we need our mcdonald thoughtoday and today only

problemssnoop seems pretty healthywhat the heck does increase the risk of heart diseasedo ya suppose it s linked to an increase of appetite and gettin the munchiesi m a extremely heavy smoker for very long time i m a 40 male quitting cold turkey this weekend i feel it in my chest good thing i don t smoke cigs tooi more concerned about the constant stress put on me by work toking one and going to workout is the most stress relieving activity in the world i guarantee i die sooner if i stop smoking weedhopefully this means the ah whose my father will die sooner rather than latterso mr mackey was right drugs are bad mkaynanwouldn t it be crazy if the train bringing the wastewater crashed and dumped all that stuff tooi wonder how many years will go by till we start seeing those were you affected by the toxic wastewater from the 2023 train derailment in palestine oh if so you may be eligible for financial compensation adsit is silly to put it on the roadway it is silly to bring it that far they will be shocked to find out how much of these compounds are shipped on a daily basis in non diluted formacid rain in nyc fuck that ceo dude should be in prisonall according to plan soon all shall be ohiolong but good article from 2012 on these deep injection wells https operators are required to do mechanical integrity tests at regular intervals yearly for class 1 wells and at least once every five years for class 2 wells in 2010 the tests led to more than violations nationally with more than wells failing in texas one violation was issued for every three class 2 wells examined in 2010one might wonder why they are shipping it all the way to texas let me err hazard a guess they can get away with cutting every corner to dispose of it with no questions asked because environmental regulation is virtually in texas if they tell you it not going into the water table it is most certainly going into the water tablenot his fault but fuck you greg abbottted cruz headin to cancuncan t taste worse than the tap water we already havei expect this is because texas has lots of deep well injection facilities deep well injection is an approved method for disposing of hazardous waste i am not defending the practice i do not believe that it is necessarily a good idea personally but it is acceptable according to current regulations one has to step back and look at all the alternatives for handling the wastewater anyone have suggestions on better ways to deal with it edit typothey fucking injecting into the ground how is this even legal oh right it texas privatizing profits and socializing losses hey no one will notice poison in the aquiferi sure abbott will put it on a bus to a blue statemy guess is that changes nothingeverything is bigger in texas even tumorstoo bad they can t send it todeer park texas ap toxic wastewater used to extinguish a fire following a train derailment in ohio is headed to a houston suburb for disposal i and my office heard today that firefighting water from the east palestine ohio train derailment is slated to be disposed of in our county harris county judge lina hidalgo said in a wednesday statement our harris county pollution control department and harris county attorney s have reached out to the company and the environmental protection agency to receive more information hidalgo wrote the wastewater is being sent to texas molecular which injects hazardous waste into the ground for disposal the texas commission on environmental quality told that texas molecular is authorized to accept and manage a variety of waste streams including vinyl chloride as part of their hazardous waste permit and underground injection control most of the comments here are acting like this is runoff heading downstream to texas this is collected wastewater being shipped for proper disposal by a company designed to handle this kind of waste for once in your life just rtfai heard that arizona was pretty hard up for water they can split itthe fine should be 70 of what they make a day not 70kweird new jersey is much closerour technology safely removes hazardous constituents from the biosphere i hear that they tow it outside of the environmentit should all be shipped to georgia the state where the corporate hq of norfolk southern ishey what a great idea what better way to keep a substance out of the environment then to inject it into the environmenti guess that s one way to create source pollution that will be impossible to trace back to sue a company over the amount of shit people eat everyday in the us from corpos and politicians amazes mequickly shoot it with gunsi sure texas will be fine they know what they doing they manage their own power grid after alltell abbott it a gift from and to red statesohio governor loaded contaminated water on a bus to texasis abbott going to ship the waste water now in greyhound busses to the big blue state cities to martha vineyard or to the white house to send a message and are the blue staters going to welcome the water with open arms before disposing it in a nuclear furnaceohio everything is fine the chemicals are out of the environment everyone well where are they now ohio i told you out of the environment everyone what s out there ohio nothing is out there httpsconsidering texas environmental standards dumping this stuff in the water supply would probably bring up the overall water qualityhttps https class i injection wells are super common i super curious how the people against this think we should get rid of this waste otherwise store it in rusty leaky barrels in ohio somewhere come on weekend reddit hobby environmental engineers make some suggestionsas a native texan our number one business is greedthey love big business and no regulations or standards in texas this should taste like sweet tea to themthat headline is deceptive the wastewater is being sent to texas molecular which injects hazardous waste into the ground for disposalremovedtexas plans to bottle it and distribute it for free in blue areastexas already lets companies dump billions of gallons of contaminaited water into public water ways you think this will lead to anything different dont mess with texas litter signs are bullshit texas government is hapoy to let companies rape their assi mean if it has to end up somewhere that a good place for itit will combine with all the fracking waste water and become safe again to drinkoh so more of the same huhted cruz visited ohiowaterways are already disgusting can t get much worsethey are simply bringing out of the environmentwtf are we supposed to do with ithave you been to deer park they wo even notice a tiny bit more nasty wastewaterthey will just dump use it for fracking problem solved ohthey ll just shoot it clean rightif you vote for people who fight against regulation that could of prevented this you deserve to drink the wateris it possible that this is the source of the trump waterlmao they shipped it to a company that plans on dumping it into the groundthe comments on this post are pure gold you guys have had me laughing all morning the reality of this is texans don t believe in toxici know it s probably harder to track but does anyone know which direction most of that fire smoke traveledsomeone told it that they fewer epa restrictions and lower tax rates i ca wait to listen to it podcasti like to think this is out of meanness but i will assume that the oil industry in texas has the best hazmat recovery we do hear anything about the company that the product for their manufacturing how are they keeping such a low profiledon t worry i heard it s safe to drinkthis is quite the clickbait title and disappointing to see from the ap just a quick read and you ll see it s talking about shipping the waste to texas for proper disposal this is frankly and just standard cleaning and disposalin some parts of texas this might not even be noticeable it one of the worst polluting states in america and first in volume per capita when it comes to carbon emissions and not just first in per capita emissions double the total volume of the 2 state and more than 3 4 and 5 combinedaverage iq in texas about to go up a couple pointsquick how can we blame pete buttigieg for thiswhich asshat republican in tx approved the legislation that allows receiving these giftsmigrants go out wastewater goes in seems like a fair tradeyeehaw com on git yur freedum water cowboys cruz r probably2 peas in a pod trying to get rid of the epa and regulations and empowering companies to take over the responsibility of government by socializing the risks while privatizing the profits bought their tickets they knew what they were getting into i say let em crashbut it texas so the state

working on the sitesend it houston they have so much pollution they wo even noticeconservative voters getting the consequences of their deregulating actions i feel for the innocents caught in the crossfirefine they shipped humans they did want to bother with to other states nothing to see herewell pun not intended at least they keeping it in the red statesdo gov abbott and sen cruz fit within the definition of toxic wastewatergood another gop cult infested area i m sorry for those that live there that don t support the gop but there is so many who do so little while those around them destroy the environment education and just human decency in the mind set of gop fever now they are going to experience the fall out the true fucks who get these sheep to vote the way they do won t be effected but just another thursday herethe damage done by 45 is incredible hoping people understand itas much as i dislike ohio texas is a good place to send dangerous garbage can we send it directly to abbottremovedfrom whence the raw material originated fromwhat are they going to do with in texas cook with it would surprise meremovedi feel like abbot will pass a no wokeness water bill making it mandatory for texans to drink the toxic watercool they can use the chemicals for something i m suregov abbott will probably bus it to new yorkhow does one collect toxic waste water from the fire doesn t it sink into the groundnangoing from i was never at the location they were killed to i was at the location they were killed at potentially minutes before they were is what lawyers refer to as not a great looki have watched this trial from day one alex had no intention of getting on the stand until that video came out his defense has been working on downplaying that ever since and i m disgusted but here we are he decided it was damning so he s testifying he s a damn lawyer and knows how to play up to the jury even if he has mountains of evidence against him today s testimony with all of that snot pouring out of his nose made me sickhe expects people to believe that mysterious assassins were waiting in the woods to kill his family even after all his lies financial crimes and then that weird incident where he paid a dude to shoot him such a sloppy murder so much pointing to his guilt he fuckedi just watched the netflix special on this dude what a fucked up family in general i feel bad for his kids because they did stand a chance with family like that it made perfect sense why paul ended up being the way he was ughhe definitely did this shit the guy never faced consequences in his life and saw what was coming and hoped killing his family members would take off some of the heat he favored his son buster but had no issue killing the other two not to mention this mf is a known liar and fraudster who has already lied on the standcan i just say not once has he said we have to find out who did this to my family nobody strikes that as strange if he s innocent as he claims wouldnt the innocent want to express the real perpetrators are out therehe also used his status as a prominent solicitor to gain favor with law enforcement he displayed this solicitor badge in this car window and in plain sight so that if an encounter with law enforcement happened he would be treated differently from the outset this man is an absolute piece of shit even without knowing that he stole money from clients people that trusted him people that rightfully deserved the money they were owedguy was dead broke and living like a multi millionairein a trial like this a lawyer pretty much only puts a client on the stand when they are getting desperate not saying that i know what is going to happen with this one not being there i most certainly do but any criminal defense lawyer will tell you that while juries are willing to overlook holes in an alibi they generally do not like people that get caught in a lie about their alibiwatching his testimony on tv my impression is that murdaugh is so used to spinning yarns and lying he has difficulty keeping his story straighti watched some of his endless testimony yesterday how was he allowed to get away with all that rambling bullshit about pawpaw i guess the prosecution figured they d let him dig his own grave this guy s a textbook narcissist and clearly a very dangerous one i think he testified just for the audience it got him i really feel for his soni glad they got this guy before he could become the green goblinhe looks like bizarro conan o brienwhy not hire someone to do it while actually creating an alibi by not being there kinda believe that he lied because he knew he would been blamed for it then again it real life and this guy probably went on a drug bender and lost his damn mind and did it did know he was before this article but reading up on the murdaugh family powerful government family that abused their authority to basically become a crime syndicate makes it sound like he be a perfect target in a hitman game or somethingadmit to a lesser crime to get off for the greater crimehave been following super close but can someone please explain to me why south carolina is seeking the death penalty here this is first degree murder he lured them down to the kennels murdered them tried to set up an alibi with the mom housekeeper he lied about being at the kennels and that totally changes the complexion of the case i do generally support capital punishment but this guy needs to go to the electric chair and south carolina allows it it not even his first murderthat guy looks guilty afi dont care what anyone says i 100 think he killed them had them killedthe fact that 2 jury members were in tears when he was testifying that one juror passed him a pack of tissues when he was crying leaves me with a feeling they wo get a unanimous guilty before the trial i thought theres no way he going to get away with this now the combination of a lacklustre unfocused prosecutor the way he somehow managed to connect with some jurors i just do know i think he absolutely did it nothing ive seen in the trial has changed my mind but it not going how i thought it wouldwatch this guy is going to try to spin this and blame it on drug dealers he owed a debt tohis last name is murdaugh have prosecutors admitted that into evidencealex his familyfun fact he lied on the stand when he said he didn t blow away his wife and sonwhat so special about this murder over all the other murders that i have to keep hearing about it all the timehe s gambling it will look like he s truthful nowwtf prosecutor seemingly giving murdaugh a pass on the difficult questions asked and answered is he legit helping him set up insanity pleaimagine being such a narcissist that you think taking the stand and admitting you lied about this is a good idea wow this guy really fucked up his life and the lives of many others what a piece of shiti watched the lawyer you know on youtube he recaps the trial daily the public opinion sways towards a not guilty verdict not sure if i feel the same i have not watched the trial from day 1deletedthis case is a weird one the lack of murder weapons the fact there are two is also puzzling and no convincing motive means i find it hard to say he s guilty of these murders he s definitely a thieving fraudster but that doesn t mean he s a murdererhaha i no longer live across the street from the trial from hell am so happy sorry had to gloat herethe more i read about murdoughs history and all that has come out about him and his family in the trials the more it seems the man is cursed madness violence pain and death follow him around he has bad jujuwhy is there so much news coverage of this specific murder when dozens of murders happen daily that are just a passing footnote to the news mediai ll admit i m coming to this with no knowledge of the background whatsoever and am just watching alex murdaugh s testimony on the stand tbh he comes off as pretty believable and persuasive he clarifies in a humble manner is righteously indignant at the times you d expect an innocent person being pestered by a vindictive prosecutor to behave that way he remembers things in a natural manner for someone being asked a series of related questions all his explanations are plausible except for his alternate theory of the crime i have yet to see anything that sounds like a gotcha from the prosecutor and in fact the prosecutor looks like a bit of a jerk however this is without having seen any of the rest of the casehe has got some good southern hospitalitydoes anybody know how he is paying for his defensedude sounded guilty as fuck on the standnani ll let my mail carrier knowthe salesperson that did that deal is pissed likely have to cancel their bugatti orderthose

are carrying quite the loadwell you release more testosterone when you are working out and lifting so seems like that would help create sex drive and more swimmersgood because i carrying the entire company on my backthank god me with my programming job and being fat as shit means i ll never have kidscould men with higher sperm counts be more likely to be employed in jobs with heavy lifting for some other underlying reason such as having higher testosterone levels that said it been shown that lifting weights boosts testosterone and low testosterone reduces sperm countlet s gooo i walk like 25 miles a day while pushing around thousands of pounds of plastic and metal back and forthi worked in warehouses most of my life one thing i learned early on was never pick something up without knowing exactly where you going to put itresearchers from brigham and women hospital found that among couples seeking treatment for infertility men who frequently lifted or moved heavy objects at work had 46 percent higher sperm concentration and 44 percent higher total sperm count compared to men with less physical jobs wait could you not just regularly attend the gymwhat if they also drink coke and pepsido listen to her boys classic wife trickor is is that men with better health have more sperm more capacity to lift things i m somewhat dubious that it s specifically lifting heavy objects at work that stimulates sperm production that phrasing is horrible idoes regularly lifting my giant balls countif u want babies get yourself a warehouse mani thought the link between weight lifting testosterone and sperm count was already established why would the work environment change anythingof course jobs that pay the least make you the most fertileas a crane operator who lifts very heavy objects i think i may have the most sperm in the worldwell it does help anybody if when they get home from work they are too tired to make their dick worki wonder if it linked more to not sitting down

in light of sedentary modern life and decreased sperm countsi must be super potent from carrying all this bullshitit fine i okay having fewer sperm but a back that does hurtso that why i shoot riversthats great but how does that help me i love lifting heavy at work or in the gym im also long term single and i dont want ffsi work a field where i lift nothing heavier than a group food order

with all their privacy invasionnanjust wait for this summer get ready to burnus power outage map httpsi can t decide if this is what the slow collapse from climate change looks like more and more extreme events that we can no longer adequately prepare or respond to or if the corruption has gotten so bad things will only get worse from here on out as funding for adequate and reliable infrastructure and services goes into the pockets of the corrupt and wealthy insteadone million power outages or one million people effected by power outagesmeanwhile in the southeast my ac has been coming on in february climate change is wildsitting here in the ne wondering when winter will starthey north america yeah this is winter gon na be a littleremovedbut the texas power maybe it s not always the grid maybe sometimes it s the weatherthe only way to address this is to bury all the power lines but which would be incredibly expensive and not even be completed in our grandchildrens lifetimes hopefully by then buildings are more self sufficient for power with solar and battery storage systemsremember when there was thousands of homes in a few counties that lost power during the ice storm in texas a few weeks ago and so many people were quick to publicly shame and blame the texas power grid the governor and the power companies while also saying that would happen in their state because their power grid is so much better to be clear i was one the texans without power for 3 days during the record breaking blizzard in 2021 that showed how badly unprepared our power grid was then and i do wish that on anyone i also know the outages from a few weeks ago were all caused by frozen tree limbs or whole trees falling on local power lines which is probably most of what happening in the areas affected now my only point is that i wondering why have we heard everyone criticizing their governors and power grids nownani smell an unfruitful internal investigation about to happenput a gun to the guy s head too ughi ca even imagine how much evil cops completely got away with before bodycams existedif it is determined that there are any policy violations they will be forwarded to our internal affairs division for a complete investigation if it is found there are no policy violations then the problem is the department policiesthat seems like a totally reasonable thing to do for a burned out tail light stop all the this shit is precisely why people think that the police are bastards who are a hairs breadth away from murdering them at any time because they arechief says everything looks good and promotes copit was a brake light why do the cops need to remove the driver from the car and humiliate him in the first place give him the ticket promptly and go the fuck away this is why i have trust issuescops nowadays are nothing but gangstersit s disgusting and people don t care enough to do anything about it that being said it would give the statements much more gravitas if they weren t shouted at the crowd by a bedazzled yosemite samanthai live in that area and it absurdly overpoliced and they seem to focus entirely on traffic enforcementpatrick royal was pulled over by a pair of jersey village police officers in late december for allegedly driving with a broken taillight according to khou bodycam footage shows royal a black man and officers disagreeing about whether the taillight is actually working or not it barely lights ca see it one of the officers says to royal the argument between police and royal eventually escalated to one of the officers commanding royal to exit his car and put his hands in the air bodycam footage from the other officer shows him suddenly rushing up to royal and his partner with his gun drawn in the video the second officer can be heard telling royal i f kill you you stupid motherf who would want these two idiots working in their city big fuck you to these copsi do care if you agree i consider this attempted murder especially considering how trigger happy cops are these days i automatically assume that if a cop has his weapon drawn that they going to kill someone justified or not i hope they fired and never allowed to be a cop anywhere and then charges edit double especially because the cop flat out said he was going to do it death threats are illegal and i think they be hard pressed to say they feared for their lives edit edit gun to the head like that is some gang shita week from now we have found our officer acted in accordance with his training and department policyit is our goal for every contact with this department to be positive and satisfactory is anyone buying thisit s crazy how many guys here are like yeah if you even so much move an inch when a cop grabs you they are justified in pointing a gun to your that kinda logic is despicable and a disgrace the guy put his phone on the top of the car and tried to stop it from sliding down you can literally see that in the video and that s besides the point which is that a cop shouldn t be trying to be judge jury executioner at a traffic stop hell in my city they stopped pulling people over for minor violations like a broken tail light because it s pointless and results in lawsuits against the pd more often than notohhhh he going to get such a vacation he definitely think twice next timesurprise another pos copthe hr people are not gon na be happy to hear about thiswhat i do get is why these fucking violent ass pigs do realize that they have body cameras recording their violent outbursts against innocent civilians do they not realize that cops across the country are being scrutinized for their psychotic actionsany interaction with the cops can end your life do your very best to avoid them unless you are up for an escalation that ends in your death and them on a paid vacationthe same police force that pointed a gun at my brother after his daughter hit him because she was texting and driving real cool guys i feel safe trusting them with my lifea black man and officers disagreeing about whether the taillight is actually working or not it barely lights ca see it one of the officers says to royal so it workedwtf lucky he did have expired tags otherwise he would been executed on the scene sad terrible ishit seems that the whole bunch might have been spoilednot only should he not be a cop anymore but he should have access to a firearm at allim more scared of the cops than of criminals these days in the usawhen will we stop letting the police investigate themselvescops the media showing all the awful vicious cruelties we inflict on the populace makes us look bad it s the medias faultit jersey village i not the least bit surprisedsomeone getting paid leavei thought the news was supposed to tell us things we didn t already knowhpd does have the same street cred as the lapd but they just as violent and have been for decadesoh look another bad applecops used to brave and humble now they re scared and full of bravadothey stand by their police procedures to rush unarmed citizens with their weapon drawn put their weapon to the citizens head and scream they are going to kill them interesting stance but not surprisingmaybe we do need to pull people over and have armed confrontation over a brake light maybe we find a way to live in a society where a lightbulb being broken does cause someone to die maybe we can just snap a photo of the light not working and send a fine to the vehicle owner instead of ruining livesjust one bad egg amiritewhy is it i do need to click through to the story to see what skin color the driver hasi thought i was gaslighting myself when i said i see these types of headlines every day but seriously every fucking day and sometimes multiple times a day this should happen at allbad apples spoil the bunchthis is texas i sure he will be harshly disciplined and possibly even removed from the force and eh who are we kidding he get some time off with pay and probably come back to a promotionthey really should do something about these cops before it gets to the point that the public turns on them and it gets even morepiggin piggin piggin down thecop in texas getting up to shady shit color me shockedwhere is the link to the video why only aprint article when there is videoremovedthere s only a few bad apples in the bunchno one is asking the important was the cop scared for his lifeprobably just muscle memory they know it s gon na look bad but they ve done it so often they just can t stopthe important moment in the video is at the guy is cooperating he puts his phone down on the roof of his car and raises his hands then the phone begins to slide he instinctively and speedily moves down his arms to catch it the officers misinterpret this as and aggression they may think he reaching for a weapon and the second cop immediately puts his gun to the suspect head it bullshit that the driver got busted for a broken taillight during the day no less most likely his violation was actually driving while black but with regard to the i can actually see how this happened why the cops did that it an unfortunate response watch the video if you not convincedit worth watching that dashcam footage a few times so the whole thing is awful and it should never have gotten to that point but here the thing as the first cop is getting ready to cuff the guy the guy suddenly pulls his arms away and reaches for something which triggers the second cop to jump in and threaten deadly force i got ta say that if a person being handcuffed pulls away to go for something force is not totally unreasonable if he had actually shot him or even physically harmed him that would be clearly wrong in my opinion but at some point a police officer has to be able to at least threaten someone that truly appears to be making an aggressive move or they are powerless i support massive police reform but i going to dismiss anyone that thinks police should truly be powerless that said why did the guy suddenly move i had to watch it a few times to figure it out but here all it is he places his phone on the roof of the car as they preparing to cuff him then it starts sliding off and he pulls his arms free to try to catch it it just unfortunate and silly that something so banal could lead to the appearance of a violent action but until i spotted the phone slipping it did look like he was suddenly going to make some kind of break and again the cop did beat him or shoot him he just threatened him under the reasonable belief that he was going to try something he going to try something but even with the dashcam footage i had to watch several times before i could see that super unfortunate but i do see that he or the cops did anything wrong at that critical point just a stupid misunderstanding maybe they did something wrong leading up to that point i do know why they would be cuffing the guy for being annoyed at them pulling him over for a partially working and that is what ultimately led to the misunderstanding so they could be to blame for escalating it that my take anywayeveryone is a mess in this story the police did everything wrong soup to nuts why did the guy away with his hands up with the cop behind him did the cop do something to him i can t tell what exactly is going on finally i m sorry but screeching cowboy hat isn t helping anythingdoesn t help that the dude lunges down and looks like he s gon na grab something from inside thethere a lot of discussion about gun control let disarm the people why is that never discusseddon t worry we will investigate ourselves and let you know if we did anything wrongdaddy teacher says every time a cop does something stupid another person becomes a millionaire that right honey the tax payers once again make another incredibly rich but the good news is the cop will get to keep his jobi know i going to get crucified for pointing this out but suddenly physically resisting a pat down like that was a stupid thing to doeveryone is stupid here according to the info in the article cop is deranged for putting a gun to a man head and threatening to kill him driver is an idiot for reaching for his phone when he was told to put his hands up jersey village police told khou that royal dropped his cell phone and reached to grab it after being told to put his hands up which they say led the officers to respond with the force and threats shown in the videothat prick was trying to get free of the cop and was resisting that s not an opinion watch the videothat website has cancer so here s a link to youtube directly httpswhat are you gon na do about it hahahahahahahhahaha cops run around and do whatever they want same with corporations and all we can do is waahhh waaaaahhh waahhhh i m gon na write a book i m gon na write a news article i m gon na share it all over online forums baaahhahahahahahaha nobody is gon na do shit so shut up and enjoy the view what are you gon na do about it huh nothingbodycam footage shows royal a black man and officers disagreeing about whether the taillight is actually working or not why try to argue about it the cops are obviously the ones in the wrong here but why talk to them longer than you have to take the citation and gtfohe is lucky to be alive he moved quickly to catch his phone as is slid off the roof the car but if you did know he was trying to catch his phone i can see how this would appear to the cops does justify the rest of the cops behavior but at first glance it looks like an aggressive move the altercation should never have happened for sure but the driver did not do himself any favorsnanhe fucked with the wrong grandmahe pushed me to the door and i got up and i grabbed him and was hitting his ass and hitting him and fighting him and i said not going to take my car youngin you go grandma i glad the neighbors did ignore her yells for helpjust because there is snow on

the complaint said when mcwhorter asked for ward identification ward began to search through his pockets and pulled out a couple of lighters mcwhorter asked if ward had any weapons and ward said he didn t think so but that he might have a pocketknife the bodycam video shows mcwhorter told ward not to pull the pocketknife out if he did have it ward did not have a pocketknife on him the complaint said ward located a prescribed tablet in his pocket and put it in his mouth the complaint said mcwhorter aggressively demanded to know what ward had placed in his mouth and suddenly grabbed ward and dragged him from the suv the complaint said mcwhorter and gonzales threw ward violently to the ground recklessly and deliberately initiating a wholly unnecessary and purposeless physical use of force against and struggle the complaint said it was a pill it was a pill let me go ward can be heard saying in the bodycam video which becomes blurred as the bodycam falls to the ground stop resisting bro mcwhorter can be heard saying gonzales bodycam video appears to show both officers wrestling with ward on the ground ward did not meaningfully resist and offered a paltry attempt at as he was trapped in the grips of two armed police officers the complaint said mcwhorter did not issue any warning to ward that he would use deadly force the complaint said within only a few seconds of pulling richard who was unarmed from the car onto the ground underneath the force being applied by both deputies deputy mcwhorter shot richard three times with his service firearm point blank in the chest the complaint said ward mother and her boyfriend can be heard screaming after the shooting what happened ward mother shouts oh my god no no she later asks can you guys do cpr ward survived for some time after mcwhorter shot him writhing in pain and shock but neither deputy provided first aid or took a pulse the complaint said instead they stood and watched him bleed out as middle school students strolled by a few feet away according to a statement from the family attorneys emergency medical personnel arrived and attempted to render aid to ward nearly three minutes after the shooting the complaint said ward was pronounced dead at the scene the officers then falsely arrested ward mother and her boyfriend seized their property and interrogated them the complaint said three days after the incident gonzalez told investigators ward was putting up a fight not complying with verbal orders and grabbed at mcwhorter s gun belt according to the district attorney s office she said she thought ward was going to hurt her or mcwhorter mcwhorter who was interviewed more than a week after the incident told investigators ward had reached into his jacket as if he was carrying a weapon he said he pulled ward out of the car to handcuff him and to check for weapons in the struggle he said he felt ward messing with his gun side and was afraid ward would get his gun knock him out or paralyze him both deputies told investigators they did not render aid after the shooting because they believed the people in the car posed a threat according to the district attorney s office source httpsdo watch the video i watched it yesterday morning and it fucked my whole day up fuck these cops and fuck the whole system that protected them double fuck da jeff chostner who said they acted responsibly fuck them for lying about it what i learned is any cop anywhere in america any day of the week could just decide to murder us and we are supposed to sit there and let them murder us we are

repercussions fuck emwhat fucking incompetent cowards they shot at an unarmed dude who was complying with their demands over a mistake getting into the wrong car and now a middle school kid gets picked up by his mom to find out some fucking pussy piece of shit cops executed his older brother fuck those guys they get payed tax dollars to protect the guy they murdered they should have training how to respond to a simple fucking situation without killing someone if a firefighter comes to your house and burns it down on duty after you called them to pull your cat out of a tree that arson and they should face the consequences proportionate with the crime they committedthe most corrupt profession of felons in the country pigs become leo so the can murder people and face no consequences many leo are also serial murderers if those same pigs did wear costumes they be in prison for life under the same exact circumstances absolutely no honor in that criminal professionwithin two minutes a man was murdered in front of a middle school two minutesi wish the feds would get involved a man who committed no crime was murdered if a man commits no crime and is thrown to the ground by police why is the man allowed to defend himselfall cops are dirty pigsit makes me think about how many times this could have happened and there was no camerawhen is he going to prison for murderdid ya ll know this cop just got awarded a purple heart for this very incidentand the cop got an award purple heart for this the police do not deserve respectnansadly it s dark waters all over again https true story about a chemical manufactory dupont knowingly poisoning a whole town and how their lawyer turned against them when he realized they were killing people the movie is worth a shot and the similitudes are hard to missthis is also the fallout of first world style conformity everybody is just going to be mad while being poisoned to death while the ceo drinks at the country clubyou have so many companies all across america doing what ever the hell they want to maximize their profits with zero accountability and why because they are allowed to not just lobby our bought and paid for politicians but they are also allowed to legally bribe our bought and paid for politicians via citizens united this train derailment is just one more example of a corporation getting away with corrupt practices all in the name of profits and just like with wells fargo and their blatant theft from their own customers not one single actual person will be charged with the crimes they deserve to face justice for instead it will be a small miniscule fine for the corporation itself and then they will move on as if it never happened while those greedy pieces of trash responsible for all of this will walk away with massive bonus checksi saw this last night and it was galling how the ceo was avoiding questions and commitments to take immediate actions for these people i understand that the ceo has responsibilities and is in many ways limited but to have him sit stone faced while reciting the same talking points over and over to these people who suffered such emotional and financial trauma that this company caused was awful it was abundantly clear they had no plan or intent to come to the table to make these folks feel they would be supportedremoved70k a day while the epa cleans up the mess for them if they choose not to do anything that sounds like the cost of doing business to meceo is paid to be a punching bag keep costs as low as possible if he doesn t he s replaced board of directors are the ones that need the blamethe ceo needs to be in handcuffsto be a ceo at that level you pretty much have to be a sociopath you can yell at that ceo all day and he wo care at best more likely he will take it as a sign that all you can do is yell and that you no threat to his true interests and that he just needs to suffer you for a few minutes to mitigate an otherwise apathetic and unapologetic lack of accountability that would tank stock prices and concern shareholders dude does give a fuck about any human but himself guarantee itlong ass prison sentences or billion dollar fines pick one or both or else it does fucking matter what you do to them they will not change unless there is actual consequencesremovedwhat vetting was done for an event like this because if i ever get invited to one i would go in loaded with information who donated how much to which pacs what regulations were rolled back by which lobbyists and exactly how much the bosses stock increased since those rollbacks i feel like i would be edited out by corporate media like cnn and all the networks it seems like we the national media is only there to prevent people in affected areas from unifing in there actions how can we get flint mi jackson ms and e palestine oh unified and active this shit can not continue we need clean water clean air and healthcare nowremovedif i lived there i would also be angry too people are getting sick and facing possible future health issues because of this this chaos and donald trumps visit to that area in ohio is just a publicity stunt northfolk southern and their ceo should be held accountable and face criminal chages the resident should also consider lawsuits against northfolk southern and their ceopeople have been killed for lessthe governor has successfully shifted any blame on his party to just the company they won t change how they vote and they will keep having things like this happen to themnice to have something to point to when my in laws claim that capitalism is self regulatingohio where republican corruption runs rampant the fbi has called ohio the most corrupt in state in the country the ohio gop is on trial right now for taking 60 million in bribes yet here we are with them still running the show httpsi hate when they do these town halls because it gives the illusion of accountability and it makes people think things are actually changing when they arebusinessmen play the game set the rules right don t whine now you all voted republicans in and supported deregulation also fck biden for making it illegal for rail workers to protestit does matter how many angry people there are unless they putting heads on stakes rich people wo change shitremovedceo now hang on you all voted for less regulation thoughpar for course when shit like this happens is the ceo s should have to relocate to ground zero of their disaster until it is cleaned up instead they usually resign their position with a golden parachute and get hired on at another firm as a consultant or some bullshitnot sure how to say this without overtly encouraging violence but why america do you care more about the genitals of children and grown adults than the poisoning of your own country why do you care about me the sexual preference of free people more than the quality of life being taken away from you how do you commit mass shootings every day on your own citizens but not these corporate scum i ca understand how small social issues of the individuals raise extremists to arms against their own kinsman but this this attack on your own country does not too blatantly consistently do corporations get away acts such as this i do not wish to incite violence but if violence is occurring why not here i speaking into the void is allnationalize the company and imprison the board of executives make a fucking example out of them and put the fear of god into these rat bastardsremember when amity s mayor said it was safe to go back in the water and then the shark kept eating peoplehow many of those people voted for republicansalan shaw needs that money you know for its pile we can t deprive the ultra wealthy of their piles of money just because our health is at risk that s wokeism it and it s entire family should never face any recoursethe american people deserve to be treated like actual people not like cattle for profit corporate greed is absolutely disgusting and this is just one of the consequences of the practice we have representatives who only push forward their own agendas and take bribes from companies to turn a blind eye might i add that the obama administration put in place safety regulations to try and avoid these types of situations however as we all know trump loved pandering to corporations so of course his administration was the one who removed the safety regulations before they could even be applied if you follow the money it will usually lead you to the source of the corruption folks never forget thathe lucky they did drag him into the street we should probably start doing that againit almost seems worth the jail time to beat this dudes ass like he killed hundreds of pets thousands of wild animals and is likely causing long term cancers and horrible environmental conditions for thousands of residents for years a little jail time seems not that badwhen the victims are being paid a few million norfolk southern is paying its shareholders billions at the same timeon wednesday dewine said the fish were killed in the first period of the chemicals release and there s no evidence showing fish were killed after the initial release points to head ca have any more fish killed when they are all deadgee i wonder what would happen if you create a ridiculously system whereby which people are 100 isolated from the consequence of their decisions i wonder what would happen wake me when the violence starts i m bored with talka super massive lawsuit against the railroad responsible like to the tune of several hundred billion dollars might make a huge difference and demand the bought out governor resign too the video on reddit showing the governor fake drinking the tap water is evidence itselfi don t think people realize just how much the rich hate us they see us as a capital commodity only if they get their way child labor is coming back no workers rights or protections and workers get paid shit if anything at all end citizens united what is the alternative we fade away into fucking miserable dust in this grand opportunity to experience life on earth why do only a few get to enjoy their time here why are we letting psychopaths call the shotsthis disaster is the cost of voting for deregulation in favor of corporate profits know more about who it is you re voting for could be a great learning experience for ohio but it won t beare these the same ohioans who keep voting for conservatives that want to deregulate everythingstop voting for regulation cutting republicanspeople need to start protesting outside of ceo and board member homesbut none confronted trump who gave people like that ceo the deregulations they wantedand people wonder why a lot of us hate capitalismthe fish were killed in the first period of the chemicals release and there s no evidence showing fish were killed after the initial release i mean you ca kill them again they were already deaddeletedthose fuckers at ns were even planning on pulling up the tracks and remediating underneath them until they got pushback from the epa and locals they looked at the spot where the spill happened and that probably has the most contamination and their first thought was it will be fine no need to disrupt rail traffic to clean thereohio residents are pissed that the conservative capitalism they ve been voting for is ruining their livesamericans are the biggest pussies and posers on the planet they love to pose for pics with their guns and tout they the toughest people on the planet in hollywood movies yet you let corporations run over you and exploit you every day even though you have the most firepower to fight backprobably voted republican and is against regulationanyone have the full town hall cnn being typical and i can t find the whole thing online at all bunch of whackos not posting the full thingfor the record it s republicans that want to deregulate everything and let businesses do as they please not politiciansthese cheaps sacks of human garbage should be jailed for lifeas punishment the ceo and management team should be forced to move to east palestine and live there for 10 years and personally help with the clean up on the groundeveryone involved in the incident including the epa should be forced to live in the town for a month and drink the same tap water and breath the same air if it as safe as they say it is then they should have no problem doing itas they should these train companies and politicians are screwing with these peoples health and safety as if it s a gameas i sit here at my desk at work i listen to drivers complain about our local ns terminal and how it a sprawling dumpsterfire of shit and my guys just have to take verbal abuse from the yard dogs moments like this put a smile on my face to a small degree where assholes like this have to look people in the eye yeah maybe it does do shit but it more accountability than i seenthere needs to be more dire consequences for destroying lives like this how the townsfolk restrain themselves from gutting these people is beyond meresident i voted for trump ceo me too and we pulled back safety regulations resident see it s joe biden side note he is also not great but at least he did roll back regulationswhat ultimately made the ceo of enron back off gaming california s electric grid was attending a town hall meeting where a pissed off resident threw a pie in his got confronted by the torched and pitchforks and got spooked this monster makes me downright nostalgic for thatsmh the epa had to order rr reps to attend the town hallthe lack of regulation stockholders over citizens is a republican wet dream it everywhere in this country just happened to shit the bed in ohio this time pos governor they have as bad as florida manohio resident here said many years ago that sowing distrust in epa and other environmental initiatives would be quite literally dangerous was laughed at and now tragically here we areremovedi guess you could say the town hall was derailedwait till people find out we done this to the entire planet we just havent become collectively aware of the damageamerica has become so fucking corrupt it s insanethe french would have held him hostage we should be more like the frenchcorporations have no soul to sell no body to incarcerate yet they arethey should have invited trump while he was in ohio he loves a crowdi feel dumb asking this but when people ask generally will there be issues are their specialists medical or environmental outside the accused company that can offer their knowledge and experience to answer these questions i feel like there has to be at least one epa worker with a chem degree and another with an i do know environmental degree maybe that can just reference the chemicals in question get some evidence of the damage and answer the question honestly also are people pissed because the governor enabling the company somehow or is this just typical general slow government applying pressure to big company that f ed up bigtimewe need erin brockovich on the caseif they do less testing there will be less concernsa ceo and top leaders at a company are required to maximize corporate profits for investors under that assumption they can claim moral cover to spend the absolute minimum on safety ceo can say they would love to spend more if it were up to them but need to maximize profits system is rigged in corporations favori wan na see the board members answer too ceo in many ways is a stooge the real fucks are the boardmeanwhile enjoy your goya beans and trump water ya chudsi surprised the people of ohio are focusing on the ceo of these train corporations with the cons so desperately trying to blame democrats for this disasteri hope the ceo realizes that in 5 years mark ruffalo is going to play the lawyer that sues them and it ll be in theaters country widethen stop fucking wasting your vote on bullshit reasonsya know what we really are just fucking dumb here in the us we really do elect people who just sell our lives away to corporations corporations are far too entrenched in the governmentbet they still vote ri thought republicans wanted unrestrained capitalism1billion invested on safety and 4 billion spent on stock buy backs shamefuli always thought wealthy white people were protected from this kind of confrontation by the public they fuck overfuck this country fuck it all it s corrupt and they clearly don t fucking care about usmaybe dont vote for usless idiots that let companies do what they want and back regulitory athorities like epa to keep those cronies in check not to mention voting for people who are compitant at their job unlike the last president who rolled back regulations and attempted to gut everything hint guess which party was involved they aint blue but ruski redstart eating the rich people need to stop being complacent and go rip these fuckers out of their home and parade them in the streets of east palestine asshole naked exposing them to the toxic chemicals they dumped on the peoplerepublicans love deregulations which lead to thread preventable environmental disastersthis isn t the first and won t be the last corrupt corp to get away with this watch the mini series on hulu dopesick it s disgusting this has become acceptable in our country perdue pharmacy destroyed this country and yet it still lives on so many tragic instances of this everywhereare happy to see turd boy show up with expired water and beanshow about those banned ingredients in food like red 40 and ingredients to keep food fresh those are banned in europe america is never angry enoughangry ohio residents should also confront their government officialsget off the wreck and onto safe ground before doing something like that guys fuck trump for rolling back regulations just because obama signed off on them what toddler logic eeeew no he touched it ickywhen will we see his head on a pike for the the long term damage he done to 5000 peoplesurprised he wasnt shot on sightfor anyone keeping score outside of ohio our governor is a fucking ghoul that is not a person that is a ghoul in a skin suit masquerading as a human being with a human soul dewine canceled the distribution of federally funded unemployment benefits during the pandemic because he thought people would return to work once the benefits ran out guess what they did under dewines watch https we observed one of the single most blatant displays of statewide government corruption with evidence that the gop in ohio took millions in bribes from energy companies dewine denied any wrongdoing but it all happened right under this nose shocking is it he a fucking corrupt soulless ghoul my memory is failing but if i not mistaken we have two energy scandals in ohio under dewine watch watching the american experiment fail in real time is pretty horrifying they poisoning us killing us making us suffer so they can own 3rd homes and buy their shitty kids into education at a prestigious school and every fucking sucker out there that blames libs or blames trump has missed the point they been pitting you against each other so you forget to blame the whole fucking lot of them that sell you out every fucking day this was never about left vs right it rich vs poor always has beensame people who were smiling while trump was handing out hats and 13 year old waternorfolk and southern stands to lose a tremendous amount of money over this the clear take away common sense regulations are good for businessthey need to ask their governor why this isn t an emergencythese people got exactly what they voted for the corporations that operate in their state were finally freed from the tyranny of government oversight the only thing that would be more fitting for them is of the federal government stays out of their lives and refuses to waste money on handouts for rebuilding maybe more tax cuts for billionaires or more guns will improve their current situation maybe the solution to all their woes can be found in hunter biden laptop i just know one thing for sure requiring corporations to follow minimum safety guidelines definitely wo help them prevent anything like this in the futurewere they clapping trump when he was rolling back epa regulations that according to him were destroying jobs did they forget thiseast palestine oh is located in columbiana county in the 2016 election they voted for trump in the 2020 election they voted for trump they literally voted in support of this derailment they voted for their city to be likely permanently tainted not only in soil but ground water as well they will never be able to safely grow their own crops ever again they will never be able to safely swim in their creeks streams and other ever again their house values will never recover their entire family s health will suffer for the rest of their lives the median income of an a city with ppl will always be anywhere from poor to destitute so they have no options they ll be wholly unable to move out of the area likely even if they wanted to for the rest of their lives then there s the folks downstream will have to endure the toxicity for years to come as well looks like theres some 5 million ppl that share those waterways this waterway dumps into the mississippi travels to the gulf this will be likely detectable for decades down stream as wellremovedeveryone here is so eager to talk about how evil corporations and lobbyists are entirely to blame for this news flash corporations will only adhere to the safety regulations they are forced to otherwise they wo remain competitive against the others who the obama administration had regulations in place that would have prevented this and the trump administration got rid of them that crook ran on a platform of government regulations are bad and there too much of it he himself is notorious for being a business man that skirts regulations he did need lobbyists to coerce him into getting rid of those regulations he supported it on principle and we all knew this everyone who went to the polls knew who he was and what he stood for everyone who voted for that bastard or did turn out to vote shares blame herenanaccording to the nyt it s a 20y sentence but 19 of them can be served concurrently with the 30 he s already serving edit if i m understanding correctly this is an extra year for filming the abuse he was already convicted of and the judge is mostly rejecting the idea that kelly should be charged an extra 20y for child pornographyis there a legal professional who can chime in on why sentences are sometimes served concurrently while it seems like a win for the convicted person my impression is that it also makes it harder to wiggle out of that time served concurrently if for some weird reason the 30 year sentence gets vacated on a technically that would really only reduce his sentence by 11 years since 19 of those 30 years are also part of this 20 year sentenceremovedtalk about pissing your career awayit s the remix to conviction sentence one year addition this time not only for creepin but for the tape of him pissinhis goddaughter in this case is the same woman who was a child in that infamous video of him from the early 2000s where he was on tape having sex and peeing on a girl that the fbi said was 14 at the time he was acquitted because he tampered with the witnesses her and her family mostly but she was indeed 14 on that tape and she was still 14 in the other tape the feds convicted him over this timethis guy spent more time in court than his careerthe language is a bit confusing anyone that speaks legal know what this technically means i interpreted it as he going to be in jail for a total of 1 year from the nyt article https in a victory for the defense the judge ruled that all but one year of the prison sentence would be served at the same time as a previous sentence that kelly received after a jury in brooklyn convicted him of racketeering and sex trafficking chargesfrom the ny times article https a lawyer for kelly jennifer bonjean argued that her client was likely to die in prison either way while this is a very serious topic he should be doing way more than 1 year i could help but laugh at the commenthe aint never getting out he will die in jailit s a year on top of his other sentence who cares let the dude rotfrom the cnn article us district judge harry leinenweber said in court thursday that 19 years of the prison sentence would be served concurrently or at the same time as his other sentence one year would be served consecutively or after that sentence is complete he said most of this sentence is concurrently with the other one he s 56 now so there s a chance he never gets outone year just one year edit thanks for the infoyall read the article good god a federal judge in chicago on thursday sentenced kelly to one additional year in prison for his conviction on sex crimes extending a sentence handed to the r b singer after an earlier trial in new york local media reportedmy friends and i to this day ca help but to laugh whenever kelly gets brought up growing up and seeing my young female friends and little cousins listening to his music and unironically finding it romantic was flabbergasting i do know of a single dude that did listen to kelly music and not say this guy is a pedophile this guy is literally singing about picking up underage girls this dude is literally grooming an underage girl right now and its in the news and every time we brought it up every woman we knew would go off about how we were just jealous we could get girls like kelly yeah dude was getting girls alright literal girls i always feel like this was something we all knew and people tried to point out and for whatever reason it was just laughed off the table that kelly was a pedo lo and behold years later his driver says he would tell him to go to high schools after they dismissed students so kelly could prowl for girls then he arrested for not only raping a minor but urinating on her and filming it its so frustrating because you really just want to say i fucking told you sonow go after the parentsso how many years does he actually have to serve in totalthat an incredibly misleading title he was sentenced to 20 years which added 1 additional year to the 30 year sentence he already servinghe is set to serve 30 years first at least it s a terrible sentence and everyone involved shot rot in hell but at least he s going to spend many years in prisonof all the things r kelly is you still decided to refer to him as singerkelly like from the boondocks episode that was like 20 years ago talk about a called shotdeletedthe world greatest child sexual abuserlol one year i love that celebrities rich people and cops get a free pass to be pieces of shit1 fucking year for known sex offender with child porn that disgraceful and a green light to these freaksdeletedthe article title right now is kelly 2nd conviction extends earlier sentence by a year x200b did reuters update it or did editorialize that titleplease tell me he cried like a little bitch when the sentence was readwhat do weinstein and kelly have in common their now concrete cells dee new punks inone stinking year wowa year does he get cable tv with that what happened to protecting the kidsyeah thats barely a slap on the wristdo think he last a year insidewhy are the scores hiddenone year how can child pornography conviction and one year be in the same sentencenanwhy should he qualify for overtime pay if he was working overtimerig pigs make good money for a reason it incredibly hard work and you are usually in the middle of nowhere for weeks on end in winterwe re at a point where the news is essentially saying good wage he deserves that money and his overtimeas a flat rate mechanic i havent had overtime pay in well over a decade fuck flat ratethe dumbest thing about this is that the supreme court actually got involvedthis headline seems designed to make me think someone making decent money and able to use the law to their advantage is unfair or something good for himit a pretty case there a test for negating overtime 1 pay must be above a threshold 2 the employee must have managerial or executive responsibilities 3 the employee must be salaried not hourly or daily the third point was satisfied everyone agreed he was paid on a daily basis in a biweekly paycheck so the firm owes the guy money meanwhile justice beer claimed that he was salaried because he always got an amount in any week he worked because the conservative justices will torture logic to side with capital if kavanaugh were followed the third prong of the test would be vestigial because any paycheck that satisfied the first prong would exceed the threshold and therefore count as salarygood on him plus overtime is nothing compared to the profits the oil companies make and he a key part of the processnext do truck drivers it bull shit i paid hourly to deliver locally and i do get overtimegood he s working overtime and should be paid accordingly no matter the salarythis is the right call they were a salaried employee and ruling in the other direction would have just ensured that wage theft becomes and even bigger problem than it already is in the ushe was a supervisor not one of the guys doing the most dangerous jobs and he got them on a technicality however if they wanted to avoid overtime they should have just salaried him instead of agreeing to pay him whatever you think of the result the company thought this was an acceptable way to do business or did think about it at all either way it their faultfucking hell how will the oil companies ever survive i tell ya how first they find a reason to fire this guy then with a new hire they lower the base pay until it equals the same with overtimegood if this worker worked these hours then pay him for themit does matter how much money your making if you work over 40hrs a week as a production employee you deserve overtime ratesdeletedever dollar that doesn t go into oil execs wallets is an instant wingood for him but it sounds like pay guidelines are arbitrary and no union protectiontruckers should be nextof course he should especially in such a high risk jobthe reasoning they used is we pay a lot so working him an outrageous number of hours is happy to see that should not be the case 80 hours is too many hours to work especially without compensation whether you make 20k or 200kgot ta love how they bring up the salary to have you against workers rights fuck these peoplewhat difference does it make whether he makes 200k or 20k if he s not salaried pay the man his ot edit i wasn t aware that ot is sometimes not applicable for employees making over 100k in that case his contract should stipulate a maximum number of working hours per week similar to an er doctor just because someone s workplace operates and they are highly paid doesn t mean they should be expected to work an indefinite number of hoursgood like no matter the context a worker getting paid for the work they do is a win billion dollar oil companies can afford paying peoplegood for him nice to see the little guy win once in a while also fuck that oil companyat that many why is he salary the company gets to screw salary employees a lot harder and make them feel like they part of the corporation my sympathies to salary

streets pay check funny how those pay stubs never make the paper 200 that s bunch for these guysovertime is overtime you want workers to work it you pay it as per your local law it makes no difference how much that person is making a year and should be completely irrelevant laws are there for a reason i worked in oil for years overtime is required by law around here most companies try to not pay it try making you sign papers saying you agree to waive overtime in trade for regular hourly rate no matter how many hours worked i worked for a company that would not hire unless you signed an agreement to not seek overtime pay they then try to guilt trip you you make good money here you don t need overtime meanwhile they making extremely large amounts of money off your 100 hour plus work weeks i worked there for two years knowing it was illegal to not pay me overtime i kept close watch on all overtime hours i documented them in a book and when it came to layoffs fairly regular in the industry i asked payroll for all my overtime gave them a number based on what i was owed they thought i was joking the bosses told me to go fuck myself and got very upset while showing me my signed paper well after 8 months of fighting them and got the government involved and was gon na hire a lawyer and take it to court i had a very strong case and all this was costing them big bucks to deal with this already received a letter in the mail with a cheque with the breakdown for the entire amount i was owed the letter was fairly nasty and stated i would never get a job again in the oilfield was fine by me i took my large cheque and moved away and onto a regular job type life this happened in 2018 and i was able to move far away take almost a year off of work and still had money left overovertime is

much he s getting paid double time for working 80 hours a week is fair period dude has the epitome of a specialized job i bet there are less than 200 people in the world capable of that level of expertisethe framing of this article is pretty disgusting why put his salary in the title because they want the working class to be against him after so much ot should it just not count anymore if he is doing the work he should be compensatedgood a win for the employee why r some of annoyed with thiswhy is this even a supreme court case the fuck is wrong with legislation in the us nowadaysimagine working one of the most dangerous jobs in the world and people balk at your ot pay because you make checks notes 200k you work more than 40 you get paid ot that should be a hard fucking concept greedy mother fuckers want to not pay him his earned wages because he already makes so muchlol what is wrong with americans that instead of being angry at the system that perpetrated the issues they are upset with the individual trying to just get a better life lol it a story as old as america got ta drag them down to hell with me yeah cool he was supposed to expect to be taken advantage of but instead he was able to finesse more money out of the same deal you just suck it up with pay people for their fucking time or you gon na see more and more of thisi make a year does that mean my ot should also be unpaid like why is the amount even relevantwow what a concept pay someone with a crazy dangerous job in the most profitable industry on the planet a concept indeedi should go work on an oil riganyone who has played rust knows how dangerous oil rigs aregood the difference between him bringing in 200k a year and a minimum wage worker is practically nothing compared to what the rich are hoarding not going to hate the man for getting paid what he owedi don t know how the department of labor thinks that employees who make more than a don t generally qualify for overtime 100k isn t anywhere near what it used to be just for reference 100k now is the same as 60k just 20 years ago 85k pre covid is 100k now inflation has been nuts 100k is just average anymorei have no problem with this he doing actual work and being incovenienced by working overtime so should be compensated accordinglygood a horrible and shitty job like that more than deserves every centcompany men are 3rd party consultants though they aren t directly employed by the exploration companies they do report directly to them but they are basically the sacrificial lamb if something bad happens you keep repeating this all over the thread and yet it s 100 false where are you getting this data that the company man isn t employed by the oil and gas company i think you re confused the drilling contractor such as transocean is a 3rd party that the oil gas company hires to drill they own the drilling rig and provide the crew at a day rate that the o g company like chevron pays the company man is almost always an employee of the o g company most of the time they re a drilling engineer that s there to monitor the integrity of the well and make sure it s drilled properlyhewitt prevailed kagan wrote because the company paid him by the day and not weekly the regulation at issue applies solely to employees paid by the week or longer it is not met when an employer pays an employee by the day as helix paid hewitt kagan wrote classic solution by the supreme court in this case it worked in this guy favor now all the companies need to do is change peoples pay rate to weekly and this wo come up againtime for agricultural workers to sue and have them toss out the exemption that makes them ineligible to ot aside from the few states that have made them eligible to it because reasons i suuure the court will side with them just like with this guyhow about we just fucking pay people for all the time that they work instead of trying to hide it in the form of oh a salary which means we can fucking screw you over but if you hourly we wo let you go to overtime because we do want to pay you x200b its all unethical fucking bullshitwhat s the issue here guy is at significantly more risk than a counterpart not to mention specialized industrygon na be kinda awkward at next monday morning meetingthat great apparently it is an extremely dangerous jobsurprise surprise from kavanaugh employee

itwhy didn t he just call the policenanthey re so brazen that they post fantasy hit lists in the comments of the fbi facebook page against anybody on the page that doesn t believe in their extremismcanada declared more than one organization a terrorist org to deprive them of funding in the us politicians employ themremovednot surprising early 2010s canada intelligence service csis notified our then authoritarian conservative prime minister stephen harper that the rise of right wing extremism was our biggest threat to national security he ordered them to ignore it and keep focusing on the muslims now csis is telling us america democratic collapse within the next decade is our biggest national security concernmost educated people have only been pounding the table about this and why free speech doenst mean just make up complete lies and broadcast them non stop our country leaders who push civil war are part of the problem and should be immediately removed from office simplethey on the fbi radar and not on at the same time schrodinger extremist i do think people realize how entrenched they are in all levels of government positions if jan 6th was a wakeup call i do know what is anymoreevery single person in america should watch american history x a movie from 1998 and take special note to how the wording from the neo nazis is exactly and i do mean exactly the same rhetoric commonly accepted from the gop todayyet we refuse to recognize that we have a domestic terror problembut tucker carlson gets a 9pm slot on the news when osama radicalized his followers and inspired terrorism he was 1 on the fbi s most wanted list why does tucker get away with inspiring extremismtons of blame to go around here the right wing from politicians to their propaganda is responsible for a normalization of this type of rhetoric and basically being stochastic terrorists our media is complicit in these killings by boosting these people whether on purpose or just for ratings either way it s disgusting our lax gun laws and poor mental health systems are to blame for letting people fall through the cracks and get access to the tools they need to commit these crimes social media is to blame for isolating us and social media companies are to blame for delegating things to algorithms that somehow keep radicalizing and literally doing nothing to stop it because it s profitable and finally we are also to blame for accepting all of this as normal and falling into the trap where if we can t solve an issue nationally we shouldn t even bother trying to fix it in our community where we as individuals can actually make a differencethere are other news outlets reporting on this same story that do bury the key word missing in this headline us mass killings linked to right wing extremism spiked over the last decade emphasis obviously mine but sadly missing hereright wing extremism left wing extremist violence is miniscule compared to the rise of right wing domestic terrorism and extremismeven the definition of extremism has changed and shifted in the same fashion as the overton window a lot of the shit people let slide nowadays is wild by the standard of years agothe rise of social media has ushered in the rise of home grown terrorism i always been been a proponent of social media because it a tool and it given people a lot of power east palestine could have been covered up without it mainstream media was not going to cover it until it gained traction on social media the problem is as always people want to make money so they weaponize it and there far too many people who are stupid and do realize they are being exploited trump is a perfect example of a con man who thinks his own followers are gullible idiots he milks them dry and they love it bannon and his friend took money from followers to build a wall and just bought themselves a boat and other things and those same people are like bannon is being persecuted like dipshit he was robbing you and to help enable all this is the mainstream media they act like all these right win con artists are good faith actors because they do want to upset their viewers by saying their side is full of grifters and because those same right wing grifters bring in money for them toolet s not pretend that extremism grew spontaneously you can thank google and facebook for turbo charging hate everywherehow much you want to bet it increased in mid 2015 edit yep i think i guessed correctly https 20and 20extremism 20in 20the 20united 20states 20inmass killings linked to extremism spiked over the last decade republicans see we told you something something immigrants something something borders muslims insert group i do like today here mostly thanks to right wing violence republicans wait whatso domestic terrorist attacks not mass killings terrorism these people arent murderers theyre terrorists treat them as suchthanks conservatives shut the fuck up about everything forever thanksthere were at least 383 mass shootings https in the usa in 2022 most mass killings are shootings so we roughly looking less than 12 incidents vs 383 that 3 of mass shootings actually if you read the report not bad 25 deaths that equivalent to lightning strikes 28 a year about 6x that many people die from chicken pox and it down from when the number was higher seems terrorism is a major danger but got temporarily much worse with donald trump and i guess that the point i wanted to make 25 a year is not alarming but the fact that it was 3x higher in 2016 is pretty alarmingand this will be orange judas didn t create extremism but he made extremism mainstreamthis is republican extremism call it what it isoh look it the daily no shit sherlock headlinenot to put too fine a point on it but they re following the leadership set by their party leaderswell no shit hatred is the right specialtywhen the president was espousing violence is it an wonder and yes the quotes are on purpose the orange one was a disasterhave us mass killings in general spiked over the last decadei could imagine tribalistic infighting because of identity politics and disdain for the other side being the cause of this huhthe internet caused this it causing extremism and distress everywhere globallyi love how they blame extremism in the headline then state that it was exclusively extremism in the article all of them every single one was aoh really i had noticed somehow i missed the news headlines every fucking day for the last 10 yearsa mass killing is extremismall the more reason we should surrender everything to conservative psychopaths obviously they re better at running things as exemplified by the number of mass murders they commit clearly they re the adults in the room just give in to the terrorists demands sweetie and you won t be harmed because these terrorists love youis is really a spike when it goes on for a decadehmm what could have led to a spike in extremism i wonder perhaps these people are somehow being social on some kind of mediathey made it great againno it more like extremism started around 2016 when you know who got electedrwnj doing rwnj thingslinked to right wing extremism only it for youhow many are linked to guns remember in the 90 when two kids were killed by lawn darts and they were taken off the market to me the solution is pretty simpleremovedthis just in water wetsif only we could ve seen this coming oh wait we did dude likely was hired by the fbi to write a report on it dude predicted all this with stunning accuracy and detailed how it would happen the fbi agreed it s a problem and then the press got ahold of it took a few lines out of context said the report writer hates our troops and america and then the fbi fired him and buried his critical report deciding against doing anything to stop the incoming tidal wave of extremismchrostians hate science and all but wait until it linked to american chrostianitymaybe the wifi bombardment and the deliberate fox news wedge being driven trough society just asking learned this last piece of crap from tucker and his lawyers just asking guys not my opinion but i have heard lots of people say thisbut wedge issues got us electedgee i wonder if referring to groups as enemies of the people had anything to do with thatyou can thank fox news for making the stupid even more upset about being dumbmake sure you call out and shame your local white supremacists and their proxies got nextdoor use it not sure about white supremacy in your state see here https supremacy and extremist violence is not tolerablewow no right wing nut defending this statement i wonder whyin america we do call white domestic terrorists that loyal to putin terrorists we call them american patriotscould they not fit right wing in the title all of them last year were right wing and so are the vast majority over the last decade the report provided to the associated press ahead of its public release thursday also found that all extremist killings identified in 2022 were linked to extremismactually it was extremism all the attackers were the victims secret gay lovers and cnn is covering it up fake newsno no that ca be truewhooooa i would hate to be media when tucker takes them to task on his show tonightyou could read the study to the people blaming video games and they still say donkey kong is responsible for the las vegas shooting the q club shootings a handful of bank robberies and traffic jamsthank the gop and good ol christian valuesthe basic is this 1 right wing extremists love guns 2 left wing extremists do like guns and prefer property crimes which are much less likely to be deadly much less kill multiple people unless they are killing a cop but those are almost always single killings not mass killings or a riot which again is unlikely to be a mass killing 3 islamic extremists do try to kill people but there are as many of them in the usa they use guns knives cars and bombsoh hey maybe it s the fucking political divide and conquer agenda that runs this country people are die hard for their political views and they keep feeding them propaganda from both sides to cause more division and hate i truly think the us has been on a sharp decline since the bush administration and it might get worse by 2030some believe it s so called nihilistic websites that literally program young people to killbased on some of these comments extremism isn t going anywhere soonthe report also noted that no police officers were killed by extremists last year for the first time since 2011 huhi saw the video of the woman whose sister was murdered at the grocery store by the guy who drove several hours to do it i could entirely empathize what she said to the killer and i don t think he thought of the people he killed as human beings there was also a tall big man in the courtroom who lunged toward the killer and had to be restrained by the state police in the courtroom from going after the killer you can t have people attacking the convict but emotionally i understand why he lunged for the guy and why the cops had to restrain himthank you captain obviouswow really what s that sarcasm thing is that itare mass killings pretty much extremism by definitiontell me something i don t knowfellows that fell for faux fucked up fallaciesit s not just the gunswater linked to hydration spiking over the last years in evolved primates look out everyone this news doesn t even try anymorein other news water is wetwhy it s almost like polarizing media and politicians have been driving more and more people from the moderate middle to the extreme fringes has consequences who would have thoughtall down to the founding fathers when they wrote the constitution all americans can carry gunsthe adl is not a credible sourceyes it s also been linked to depression and other mental health issues where s the study linking mass killings to youwell i m sure if we continue to allow the free speech of these right wing extremists to matter more than the rest of our lives we ll be fine even better maybe we could limit access to guns and give the far right police force the ability to pick and chose who gets charged with these crimes oo while we are at it lets exempt all police from gun laws to make sure we do nothing of value we can continue to belittle all potential extremists while electing politicians who care more about playing nice with these fascists than actually doing anything oo we also try ignoring that these killers were children that were failed by the system just years before they snapped maybe just being mean will help to deter these potential murderers i m sure if we continue to ignore or refuse to change any possible sources for these problems we will be totally fine i mean it isn t like all of this is all we did in the ten years leading up to this increase in right wing extremist killings even better lets pretend it isn t a right wing only problem so that we don t hurt any feelings but lets also ignore empathy when we do talk about right wing extremism that ll show them that they re wrongare you sure it was a spike and not going from strength to strength has it just midway up the foothills and on its way to the mountain peakyou mean gang violencedoes tops still exist and are they still mopping their floorsca wait for extremism 2 electric

recalled they offering a free replacement just had to take pictures of the front back and underside along with the batch number and literally cut the powercord to verify i disabled it which i did so hopefully they actually do ship the replacement nowthe cornballer all over againwe had an air fryer turn into a rolling ball of fire on our back porch about a year ago i wonder if it was one of the

whenever the sales hit by which i mean this brand goes on sale often enough that it memorable resulting in a rather large installed user base that will probably never ever hear about this recall suddenly really happy i bought a gowise instead even if i on my second one because the first had a fan die at least mine have never ever caught fire so there thatthey offering replacements as part of the recall they actually have a whole selection of products that it can choose from if you do want a new air fryeri was actually planning on buying an air fryer until i read some professional kitchen

doctors who came into contact with the girl who died or are there multiple cases of bird flu jumping from infected birds into human hostsno report of transmission still 12 is a surprising numberand here we go again not what we want to hearluckily we have a well established methodology for updating and putting out annual flu vaccines that are cheap free for everyone should be an issue at all no one would ever refuse a vaccine for a deadly easily preventable disease x200b on a side note plague is way way harder than it should be given how people in the real world apparently react to vaccinesof all the places for a potential pandemic to kick off i ran the hanoi office of a fortune 100 company part of my brief was to keep an eye on opportunities in cambodia to look for an opponent to the country after the company left in the 1950 s it was the only asian country i worked in that faced administrative and fundamental governance issues similar to those in the democratic republic of congo or south sudan it s different in that government departments and structures exist but they are hollow and mostly ineffective the things that work best are governed at the level even then impoverished villages generally run better than large towns or cities i put it down to the khmer rouge murdering or chasing out the country s educated and brightest people in the 70 s it s truly shocking the single glimmer of hope if human transmission of h5n1 is taking off in cambodia is that the population has some experience of working with the un who and ngo s in battling and largely containing some dreadful variants of malaria or i suppose the cambodians could hand over their public health system to thai businessmen and gangsters paid enough money they seem to be able to get stuff done in cambodiamy wife is khmer she tells me that it is common for khmer people to eat birds as in birds most people would eat outside of ducks like songbirds and suchi think this about sums it up httpsthe part of this article that concerns me most is that they are searching for cases in schools it may just be that it is an easy place to mass test or that children are more likely to handle birds or it could mean that h2h is suspectedcovid to the left of me marburg to the right here i am stuck in the middle with bird fluwe just need 15 days to slow the spread and everything will be fineplease get your flu shots if you have alreadyanother flu amazing who cares anywayshow long until this is weaponized by political partiesdeletedremovedi won t take the h5n1 vaccinenanso not only was he presumably innocent because the charges got dropped but he also got the shit beat out of him by the co am i understanding this correctlyjail can be very dangerous environment not only from other inmates but from the guards itselfthe guards should be given the same treatment that they gave him a nice beating to reflect onblond boys doing what blond boys do edit well shit i didn t mean it was a good thingnanso what s his point that murdering children isn t so bad because it saves tax payer money so let s be more lenient on child murderersmr eastman asked the experts how they would respond to what he said was an argument that in the case where child abuse is fatal obviously it not good for the child but it actually a benefit to society because there are needs for government services and whatnot over the whole course of that child life x200b later the outrageous accusation that somehow i and members of my district support the extermination of people or support child abuse when i staked my entire political career arguing for the opposite is not acceptable in this body he said x200b if you did want to be accused of saying those horrible things then you should have said those horrible thingswhat a complete and utter piece of shitnot even the first time he been censured for morally repugnant remarks he get reelected like last timenot enough disgusting and then his follow up question after already being told the loss of a child is immeasurable was does that million get higher or lower depending upon the age at which the child is killed wtf is wrong with some of these peoplewhen people show you who they are believe themits scary when satire becomes reality httpseverything is about money to these corporate fascistshe said the quiet part out loud republicans only cares if the baby is in the womb but after that they dont give a shiti can think of a few ways he himself can save taxpayer moneywords have consequences you twathow much longer until someone suggests simply euthanizing foster kids because it cheaper for the statedafuq does he not remember that abused children have abusers abusers that will cost society a great dealpeople voted for this guythank goodness for thathere is the sociopathic idea should govern without emotions on display they want to value lives in dollars onlyi remember this dipshiti m impressed republicans can usually do literally anything and not get censuredin case anyone was curious and didn t want to read the article yes he is a republicanthe least they could domitchell and webb are always good but this sketch is particularly relevant httpsi will say this and with my mean every word of this with my entire heart alaska is one of the most racist god loving terrifying substance abuse child beating place i have ever been and tho i will always long for alaska and the things from when i was a child i will remember that alaskans scare me not some not a few most i have my own kids and i married and there is no way in hell i would take my children near that place i would avoid it like i do florida except florida is less horribly racistwhat if and i just going out on a limb here but what if that child grew up to be a taxpayer i feel like that possibility might just wreck that dude mind if it occurred to himand is he prodo elect psychopathsthat is some malthusian fiscal modest proposal on the wrong side of poe lawthis should surprise anyone but if the population keeps voting in these fascist chuds then they get the world they deservei surprised he did go with the i an unrepentant optimist i was just

workforce labor chemical spills childcare teen and younger pregnancies whateverwell wasilla is sending their best bet that guy has some skeletonswasilla well golly gosh darn then why doncha just get yer kill on with the kiddies ya knowi guessing he did account for all the taxes that child would have paid throughout his life if allowed to live and grow he thought he was doing a gotcha but really just showed himself a ghoulif the systems we put in place don t exist to protect people from at least wrongful death then what exactly is the point of the systems we fund with taxesfiring him would save tax payer moneyhe was making a prolife statement as in he doesn t care about nonabstract suffering he only cares about fantastical wrongdoingssorry bud you no jonathan swift and that ai a modest

an american republican politicianit s disgraceful disgusting and shows his contempt for poor peopleand here lies the problem if you are going to make utilitarian arguments you best be prepared to defend yourself with finite resources one can agree that triaging limited resources to those that have the greatest potential for survival is a necessity like some hospitals were forced around the globe in overwhelmed areas at the absolute worst of covid but outside of such moments anyone who is not a robot or complete sociopath the idea of letting children die because it s cheaper in the long

hateful ugly people the kids are becoming increasingly nasty towards each other and they are not alrightwhen i was a kid many years ago i had a racist cousin about 16 years older than me he often said horrible things and younger me did understand much of it but had an idea something was wrong i figured it out when one day my dad came home early from work and overheard my cousin he went off on my

people around themoh they late i was called n r in first grade seriously kids learn this shit at home and most white kids outside of general teasing that kids do do have to deal with this at all

gave a chevron refinery the green light to create fuel from discarded plastics as part of a initiative to boost alternatives to petroleum emphasis mine and the cancer risk according to agency records obtained by propublica and the guardian the production of one of the fuels could emit air pollution that is so toxic one out of four people exposed to it over a lifetime could get cancer emphasis mine for more context that risk is times greater than the level usually considered acceptable by the epa division that approves new chemicals aside from the chemical that carries a 25 lifetime risk of cancer from emissions another of the chevron fuels ushered in through the program is expected to cause cancers in people also far higher than the agency allows for the general population the epa division that screens new chemicals typically limits cancer risk https from a single air pollutant to one case of cancer in a million people emphasis mine the lifetime cancer risk from breathing the emissions from the chevron jet fuel is higher even than the lifetime risk of lung cancer for current smokers i highly recommend reading the article there s a lot more there than i covered in this comment including the people who are disproportionally affectedlet see make plastics from fossil fuels for profit make fuel from discarded plastics for profit profitthese big corps just do give a fuck

burning plastic would be a good idea for a fuel source aside from the ones making money off itif you think that the people at chevron did know that you are very badly mistakenperhaps chevron needs to update it logo to skull and crossbonesthis is why regulations are needed corporations will kill us all for a quick buckdiscarded plastics as alternative to petroleum just where tf are these plastics coming from if not petroleum this is like saying we will only burn logs in an effort to stop burning treescancer risks aside is this fuel source actually does it produce more energy than it requires to manufacturefrom propublica as well https this is frankly insane and needs to stopwhat a bunch of conscienceless scumbags they deserve to be boycotted into bankruptcyhuman stupidity coupled with a nice touch of greed can indeed accomplish incredible stuffi suppose if they use the logic that fewer humans better environment they would have a solid argumentbut the agency won t turn over these records or reveal information about the fuels even their names and chemical structures without those basic details it s nearly impossible to determine which of the thousands of consent orders on the epa website apply to this program in keeping this information secret the epa cited a legal provision that allows companies to claim as confidential any information that would give their competitors an advantage in the marketplace totally unacceptable as well as utterly despicable no provision should be permitted to serve as legal cover for corporate criminality or even taken seriously in it that allows info re such highly dangerous toxins to be kept secret enough of this decades upon decades upon decades of corporate greed taking precedence over public safety is there any way to sue both the epa and the corporate criminals into doing the right thing and releasing this information no wonder we are so fucked as a nation talk about capture of thei just shared the same article i hope it gets more attention this shit is insane i rapidly losing faith in the epa like what the actual fuckthis is what happens when the gop puts corporate friendly heads in all these agenciesregulatory capture does not magically go away when administrations changedetective benoit blanc needs to get to the bottom of this statdeletedso it helping the environment by killing humans prefectplease remember the guardian wrote the articlenannanladies if you are a veteran and need an abortion you can go to the doesn t matter what state it s a federal agency and not at all bound by state lawseveryone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together could see this outcome it will unfortunately be replicated in other states tennessee has screwed themselves for the next years in 9 months just because they want to control the choices of the populationchild services in disarray tennessee abolish the inadequate dcs give the money to churches it part of the planas a burned out cps investigator this could be a lot worse than you think all cps organizations are on a state level so there are 50 different ways of doing things but as i understand it my state is pretty common our model is designed to churn through social workers because it s a prestigious job in social work but it s a nightmare to actually do instead of having support enough staffing for manageable caseloads and a quality workforce it s a lot easier to just churn through social workers the average entire career of a cps social worker in my state is 9 months i learned this from my state s 2 position at dcyf they re well aware this is the model i was the most senior member of my unit after 6 months on the job 95 of our calls are bullshit usually just a crazy misunderstanding but often someone with a grudge calls in something stupidly too the 5 where we have a safety threat takes up 75 of the job allllllllll those unwanted babies could easily break the entire system the courts are going to get slammed with dependency cases social workers are going to get churned through at an insane rate we ve been neglecting the safety net for a long time a lot of babies are going to fall right throughit s like no one reads history the romanian orphanage scandals aren t that long ago when the ceausescu regime in romania banned abortion and birth control in an attempt to raise the population levels they ended up with hundreds of thousands of kids their families couldn t afford to feed those hundreds of thousands has babies that turned into millions of kids clogging the underfunded state orphanages kicked out at 18 with no education no social skills and no prospects crime drug use and related issues skyrocketed they moved into the sewer system for shelter and promptly started popping out babies of their own in the sewers it s a human rights nightmare to this day httpsthe one thing all the laws have in common is that they failed to consider what will happen to increased number of babies and how many of them will end up in the adoption system they did consider so did give extra funding toabortion will remain illegal in red states as long as wealthy women can still travel to blue states this allows those in power to reap the benefit of appearing tough on the issue without having it personally impact them or their familyit almost like the amount of real suffering of sentient people created by banning abortion is much much more than the suffering of an abortion of a fetus and you know these idiots who voted for these politicians are not all standing up to become foster parents value life until it bornthe inevitable outcome was that states would be overwhelmed by babies given up by women forced into giving birth when incapable of caring for an infant the next inevitable tragedy will be states unable to financially sustain a foster care system bringing back the orphanage system to warehouse babies many who will grow up with no family children were cherry picked from orphanages to suit the needs of the people shopping taking the best first and some sadly taken for no other reason to become babysitters or a labor source physical and sexual abuse was also a sad consequence of the orphanage systemwhat all these right wing republican zealots don t understand is that they are creating a massive backlash that is going to haunt the gop for the next generation unfortunately until sufficient anger builds and does it s job lots of human lives are being damagedmany of us who support abortion rights said this scenario would happen want all these babies born yet rant about them when they and the parents end up on welfare or using other social programs seen as entitlement while completely ignoring the broken foster care system and the babies children and teens part of it now more babies will end up in foster care or run the risk of being abandoned because of republicans and their need to control and oppress women through their warped religious beliefsit s simple really build big dorms at meat packing plants maybe some more at the honda plant circle of life arbeit machtbabies will be born as actual humansi wonder what will happen with crime ratesthe cruelty is the pointthe cruelty is the point though republicans love thisthey want more vulnerable children they need them now that epstein is deadconservatives only give a shit about unborn children once they are born they might as well be thrown directly into an incinerator for all they carenanthis happened in 2021 the guy has already pleaded guilty and been sentenced to 15 yearsi like how they are investigating the bartender nothing like going after poorly paid service workers who get bullied if they don t serve and are somehow liable for not being psychic about what some drunk is going to choose to do after they leave the bar of course cops can shoot you dead while violating your civil rights and if you drink at a cops house and do something stupid he still has privilege this system is just pandering to the lowest common denominatorafter seeing the video of the pursuit and face plant into a row of bricks i really hope the guy who caught him got therapy he sounded wrecked and who could blame him the guy who died was instantly identifiable as dead and that usually means it s something traumatic to seeits situations like this where the murderer should have to pay alimony after killing a parentpolice also released video evidence from the investigation into the bartender they say served that drunk driver so much vodka that his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal i wish there was a law that requires drivers to give their keys or driver license to the bartender if they want to be served alcohol they would get their keys back if they can prove they are sober enough to drive or can prove they have a sober friend or have a ride share coming this would reduce so much drunk drivingi get it heroic to help stop a criminal but it not your job do do work for the state for free you do get benefits workers comp or protection if you hurt someoneif his car had licence plates this is a little over the top somebody has video of him obviouslynaneast palestine has a population of 4718 so 1378 per person not near enoughthe ceos house cost more than 6 millioni keep saying nationalize rail but for perspective freight rail is federally protected with federal grants and subsidies supporting it a federally supported and run retirement program for employees and federally advanced by improvements at port authorities facilities which are and you guessed it public agencies on top of this the employees can t strike or take sick days by edict of a federal employee and they are a federally recognized asset critical to the operation of our nation the giant messes made by their cost tens of millions response from federal responders but all the profits are private even though they could fund public transit on the same federally protected rails beyond anyone s wildest dreamsthe difference between billion and million is almost exactly billionjail the top executives that the only way massive disasters like these will stopthose poor disaster might dip into their profits a bit seriously though this is pretty fucked upthat better be million per familyonce again and i ca iterate this enough and listen to one fact today to think about corporate america only obligation is strictly fiduciary their obligation is to maximize profits for their shareholders nothing else that is their primary goal and it is on the back of the worker and general population they have zero human interest as long as they are making money you are a dollar amount above all they will do all they can to protect that profit margin at all costsin perspective a man named corporation gives to his friends and gives you 6 and fifty cents for making your city a toxic ground for sickness and death indefinitelythe greed in this country is unbearablearrest the executives fines are not a punishment for the rich if corporations are people why do the people in charge have actual punishments for breaking the lawsremember the difference between a million and a billion is about one billioni wish we could visualize million billion it would probably make the million look so tiny like the earth the sundoes the city have a pop of 5k is it only i sure it is exactly like that but for the sake of argumenteveryone gets a ps5 they can enjoy before they die from cancerfor the love of god make stock buybacks illegal like they were before reagan they are a blight and completely warp how companies functionthe bigwigs will get a hefty bonus this year likely more than millioni think it hard to understand the scale of money we talking when you just use the word billion they giving million to victims and million to share holders makes it easier to see the shear absurdity of iti live very close to there and there have been lawyers there since just after the accident who will be filing class action lawsuits against norfolk southern they re going to end up paying far more than that in the long run hopefullythe fine is a margin of error for themmillion per person righttime to nationalize rail it s been timemoney really is the real god of america sadit cheaper to give entire towns cancer than pay for breaks and bearingsi fucking hate corporate americai m willing to bet norfolk will spend much more than million on the pr campaign to cleanup their image it s the only cleanup they really care aboutremovedfought safety rules because they are too costly but can afford billion in stock buybacks yay unregulated capitalismshit like this will always happen until people that run these companies are held accountable by that i mean heavy fines and or prison timethey should have bought stock instead of getting in front of a toxic train duhhi mean they ca very well sacrifice the 401ks of innocent investors can theythat number needs at least 2 zeros behind is like a fart in the wind compared to the damage they ve done and will do if not made an example oftime to loot the company before the billions in fines and compensation come duecapitalism will be the end of us there only so many resources and we should be putting profits ahead of people or societyshareholders should be sued for damages too then fuck your blood moneytown of all getting each should do a lot to prevent this in the future oh all of them sharing the well after the lawyers take their cut they should really be happy to split a few hundred amongst themselvescourts need to stop fining corporations they need to start shelling out fines as percentages of the corporations profits when the stockholders start losing money corporations will start paying more attention to rules and regulations40 margins cry me a riverhow can the average person hurt norfolk southern legally is there a way the floor is openthe fines should be painful not a minor technicalitythat wo cover one families hospital bills in the long runcost of doing business i guess fuckin capitalism is grandi feel no compassion for norfolk and southern my brother worked for norfolk and southern they treat their employees like s and apparently they treat the people whose communities they utterly destroyed through their own malfeasance like s too the amount they paying is literally pocket change to them they real fear is that the shareholders are not going to like how much money they lost because of this and oust the leadershipmil divide by 1888 households in east palestine alone is about per household they trying to get off easy by dictating the settlement payout with a fast march before lawsuits this does even account for the people down wind and outside east palestine that will probably have a sharei think we need to switch these 2 numbers aroundand they will declare bankruptcy in three twocheaper to payout victims than upgrade and maintain equipment and pay for the people to maintain itone thing has nothing to do with the otherhere some money to buy water good luck with that cancer and renal failurethe has to be a good lawyer who can get them a lot more than thatyes to the delight of the republicans maybe the state of ohio that was once was a great union state will now wake up and stop listen to right wing republicanssound like they need to be nationalized for those that invested in it and lost money that is tough titties you put money in a failed business investment is supposed to have some riskthe fra estimated those better brakes would cost the entire industry 493 million spread over a period of 20 years hmmmm million per year for new brakes against a billion single year stock buyback yeah i guess they right it just too damngive that billion to the victims the company can find another way to pay their billsnobody on the inside fucking cares at all end of story this is the economics we created in the us they do have to care it not about the visible stuff it is always about the skimtold my wife 3 days ago that norfolk would face some charge of such a petty amount it look like a joke like someone being fined a penny for murder when they have 1000reverse those numberstrue yet they did also ask shareholders to pass the hat for the townsfolkall of their assets should be frozen until they clean up east palestine and the rivers they re barely gon na lose anything from this disasterthe amount should be reversed shareholder get million and victims receive billionwhy is america so behind on the train system when the majority of developed countries are on bullet trainsthis is just the beginning the lawsuits will be in the billions deepwater horizon was like 60 billion the erin brockovich case was 333 million this will be somewhere in betweenthat s how much they have left available under their repo plan not how much they ll do it was also authorized before the crashwhy haven t we dragged everyone and i mean everyone https executives politicians both down to the accident site to clean that crap up themselves and since they think all that stuff is so safe to transport as is they won t even need hazmat suitshow much is that in sick daysns does pay a dividend do there that this is only a matter for the short term long term the company will be finethose profits ought to be put on hold until people in ohio get unfuckedhear me out fines should be a of company revenue and to all the temporarily embarrassed billionaires that are worried about all the companies that might bankrupt good that the point because they simple be replaced by companies that play by the rules like if kroger and walmart were bankrupted for their wage theft you think more store like costco would pop up in their placeshit like this has to change or shit like this will keep happening what is the actual real cost for this gon na be likely hundreds of millions of not a billion or so dollars where is the actual fine that reflects this who is in charge of this mess we ca keep letting this stuff happen or we will have no safe water to drink anymore it already pretty much like that since trump defended the epashareholders are not liable this is a way for the executives to cash out and funnel money out of the business asap before the lawsuits start piling up by the time assets get frozen by the court there wo be anything left to pay creditorsit ridiculous i was watching the cnn town hall yesterday they put on people from east palestine and they had the chance to ask the norfolk ceo about their community suffice it to say the people were not pleased one of them a man in his 60 railed against norfolk and said their company sucks he wanted to know how a train could have 2 trainees driving it and the ceo kept deflecting by saying he could comment on an existing investigation those were the answers the community wanted to hear they wanted to know why a few days after the accident trains were running again on the tracks it was very difficult to keep a dry eye throughout the special the man in his 60 said his land value went way down because of the accident he worked his ass off for so long preparing to retire and then his land value dipped he wanted to know if norfolk would compensate him or the community for that i felt so much sympathy for what those people are going through especially when many of them complained that they went to the doctor with chronic nosebleeds and the doctor said we do know what going on we ca do anything about this norfolk should be doing everything they can to clean this shit up and the epa pretty much mandated it on the show yesterdaywho are the shareholders what are their names who the hell is profiting off taking the water and making hundreds of thousands of families drink this cancer shit and don t any of you dare buy produce out of these effected areas because you know these evil sob s will try to sell it to us and say it s safeoh no capitalism is working as intendedohio voted red regulations that red wanted kermit facemillion each or million totalwell so long as they have their priorities straightgot ta pay the shareholders before the company gets sued and the stock price plummets i wager the trade volume goes nuts after that dividendthey should be made to pay every resident no less than the sum of their last contributions to all ohio legislatorsremoveddamn and so few happen to be maybe be cuz poor i can has chezburgerrto be fair they have 1000 derailments a year so 6b in payments over a yearremember when they wouldn t let the rail workers strike and the real workers warned that the trains were understaffed and it would be dangerouswhat about wildlife rescueif they believed in a future they would reserve that as a buffer i guess they just want to cash out and possibly take the fall if they ca avoid itcleaning out the bank account when the top brass get huge bonuses bankruptcy is nexthopefully this didnt come as a surprise to anyonei manage a small fund and had the pleasure of selling off around 5m of nsc from our clients portfolios a couple days ago because of this fiasco it felt good seeing it pull down the stock for a couple of minutes it sad that all it didits also planning to shell out billion for a railroad owned by cincinnati ohio fairly unique that an interstate railroad is owned by a city imothat less than a percent of their net income in 2022 billionso really they need to be pinged for about 500 million to make the sensible option of getting the fudge out of there available this seems fair and if it was this expensive to fuck up i bet it doesn t happen as oftenunless you made of money nobody cares about you and even then they only want you for your moneythey are planning to spend million to people and the government i wonder how much of it will go to the people how do they know how much the government will fine them the rr initially offered the people 1k the rr should be banned from making political contributions and lobbying for the next 20 years they have too much power and influence over both parties we should not accept derailments per year the environment does matter the people matteri continue to find myself wishing that the railworkers had gone on strikethe billion can be written off in their taxes it s a justifiable operating expense i don t believe donald trump remembers eliminating critical safety standards he only remembers his achievementsremember that this negative externality is going to be passed onto us the consumer through higher shipping cost and norfolk southern won t loose a dime or learn a lesson the only true recourse is through government intervention the resource conservation and recovery act was only established in 1976 if it wasn t for government intervention we wouldn t have clean air drinking water and the cuyahoga river would still be on fire corporations only care about revenue which they should and pay attention to which politicians are funded by these cuntsless than 1 of what shareholders are getting and an iota of profits corporations committing atrocities need to be paying tens of billions at least not some incomprehensibly small percentage of their overall profits these tiny fines and payouts are so small they probably do even include them on their analysis reports and will not discourage them from harming or even killing people with reckless disregardto within a tenth of a percent the difference between billion and million is billionthat is what their job is shareholders are number one after the gets their cut duh1mm per resident would be the bare minimum for them to at least relocate somewhere else until they can get an additional settlement for their unsellable property they took a lot of risk now its time to eat the lossthis is the american economic system at work it what the people want what the victims themselves would vote for and die to defendnanaccording to a letter from the copyright office seen by reuters images in a graphic novel created using the system midjourney should not be granted copyright protection the letter stated that the author of zarya of the dawn kris kashtanova is entitled to a copyright for the parts of the book that kashtanova wrote and arranged but not for the images produced by midjourney this decision is significant as it is one of the first rulings on the extent of copyright protection for works created with ai the decision comes at a time when generative ai software like midjourney and chatgpt are becoming increasingly popularthis will be ai achilles heel should the courts continue to rule against ai creations this way once companies realize they can not rely on copyright to restrict the use of any content its only use will remain as a toyif you use ai to create something then claim it as your own and get it copyrighted how will anyone prove it was created by aigot ta love seeing prompt engineers eat dirt the karma for all the nasty comments about how ai is coming for your jobs and making you obsolete is coming to bite them in the asswhat level of personal involvement in creating the art is required for copyright protection what if i did significant work on the ai generated image in adobe or other software what if i manually altered just a few pixels making that part of the image my personal work conversely what level of software automation would render an otherwise human generated image ineligible for copyright where is the line drawneveryone needs to learn the keyboard shortcut now you can copyright everything you say yeah i know that not how it really works but at this point why notin fact whatever artists inspired the ai should have a chance at ensuring their art hasn t been used without permissioncorporations should be able to use artificial intelligence machines to restrict the art and earning potential of human beingsi finally have an excuse as to why my short stories keep being rejectedthis sounds like good news for actual artists if you want to protect your work with a copyright then pay an artist to do ithow would this apply to text there are numerous news aggregator sites as well as numerous ai tools writing whole articles if ruling applies to all ai creation then a significant percentage of written articles online would lose any copyrightsthe work around is to take a photo of the ai image then magically your photo is fully copyrightable just like any asshole paparazzi with a camera that pushed a button at a scene they had zero input in creating or populating get to copyright their photoswhat if the ai applies for a patent or copyrightthere no way such a law would hold there is no ai there is just computers that have more modern programming called machine learning and sometimes specialized chips to help it just a tool like any other computer program if you can take copyright away machine learning for image generation you have to take copyright away from any tool using machine learning which is completely ridiculous does photoshop use machine learning these days soo everything made with photoshop ca be copyrighted because ai or more accurately because ya have no idea what ai is right now it just a marketing term for machine learning which you been using in your phones and apps for a couple years now so will this be retroactive will we take away the copyright from any content that used machine learning over the last 10 years right now the people thinking they can regulate out smarter code and tool are basically all in a giant line taking turns humping an ai doorknob there is the slightest sign of real ai and you all are mad at the filters for doing stuff you ca guess what though photoshop was always doing stuff you as a human could not do on your own the problem is ai it your copyright laws and frenzied lack of understand of what the marketing term ai means this is also why you should not use ai as a marketing term this stuff is ai and trying to upsell it like that makes people more intimidated by it than they would otherwise be if this tech was called like text generated art instead i bet it would be getting half the pushback or lessjust say you drew it yourselfanything that an ai puts out shouldn t have any protections because an ai can t create anything it would be like awarding cnc machine a patentif companies own all work products created by their employees and ai is a tool used by employees seems reasonable they would own the work product of the aias much as i love art its hard to say if you use an image you generated after hours of perfecting prompts and use it for a book is someone allowed to use that exact image for something elsedoes this give me permission to use ai generated photos from other midjourney users for my business without repercussion just thinking out loud i use mj for my business and sometimes i other users will reroll my images if i catch them using rerolled photos for their business i guess i ca go after themthis is pretty big there is going to be a future where movies are made with this technology i do not think there is any doubt i also expect new characters to be created where they seem like real people even becoming very famous but it sounds like they will not get copyright protections i could see this being addressed again in the futureif i used an ai program to create something that i then copied by hand is my copied picture covered by copyright serious question how much human input is required before something gains the ability of copywrite protectioncurrent law allows reddit to cut and paste massive amounts of copyright protected material rap artists are allowed to cut samples from music and copyright the final product i am allowed to write a novel in the style of mark twain and even insert copied material in some cases i can cut photos and make a collage worth millions in its own right mixing of art to produce another work of art is common the panic is being created now because the ai art is often much better than the original art samples every new visual technology creates fear when it replaces some older technology often for good reason artists were outraged when photography replaced their hand renderings of people and placesseems like people are going to use images but never own up to it in order to maintain copyright now i do know what the copyright office thinks it accomplishing with thismakes sense for some points like that you can randomly recreate an image with an ai that was made beforenanwell before the typical narrative was to publicly call these lonewolf attacks and pretend all associations to hate groups was pure coincidenceweird how anti lgbters and neo nazis intersect so oftenwhat a shock this happened again for the hundredth timewell color me completely unsurprisedremovedit s always the ones you most suspectweird how a was stopped by richard fierro a us army veteran yet i havent seen republicans celebrating fierro as a heroif only there were some kind of sign as to why this keeps happeningfor some reason being a neo nazi isn t confirmation enough that you re a waste of air so he shot up a club for everyone still on the fenceof course he did between the denver cops shooting innocent people at a food truck and the multiple police murders here lately everyone here expects law enforcement to either be completely useless or come out with guns blazing it s sad that the local government won t even touch the issuei eagerly awaiting the brigade of conservative trolls claiming that not only is he clearly left wing because no right winger would identify as non binary but also that he clearly left wing because nazis were really socialists its in the name national socialist you know the usual dumbass bad faith historical revisionism they engage ini beginning to think this guy was really non binarysighs remember when americans were incentivized to kill nazis pepperidge farm remembersah an america first typeremovedis that what they calling trump fan sites these daysweird since twitter told me that he was a liberal gay manlet me guess his neighbors said he was quiet and couldn t imagine him doing anything like thisgee i sure wish we had some kind of law where people who are blatantly and publicly hateful and psychotic would have their guns confiscatedlet not ignore the fact that it also says they used gay and racial slurs in gaming meaning that it might not be as harmless as people make it out to beso wait when i called this guy a right wing nazi incel i was in fact right crazytucker carlson called reporters who reported this information early on despicable liarsstill pushing the fiction that their being is anything other than a red herring thoughsurprise it s againcan we call him a terrorist now can we charge everyone on his site with aiding and abetting terrorismdammit well putin better mobilize what remains of his forces to invade the usa to rid us of this nazi problemthe ap just running with that he was based off a troll tweet shoddy fucking reportingit s always the people with right wing ideology doing the mass shootings now it seems maybe we need to keep conservatives away from children since they are instilling this in themaldrich who identifies as nonbinary and uses the pronouns they and them claims to be non binary i doubt it trollthey re all nazis spawned by fox news and the republican party these people are pure trashthere have been reports that they were aiming to create chaos for years lone wolf shootings across the country and attacking infrastructure etc as well there was a nazi and his girlfriend rounded up a week or two ago for almost inflicting damage well at least they have the right wing ecosystem and fox news allies like tucker to blame the other side for not meeting with the victims and running defense for emgun rights over peoples livesyou mean the person who shot people was hateful no if only it was much harder for him to aquire a firearm man if onlythank god that drag queen had heels onall of these people have headlines where it s like this dude ran an obviously bad thing and it was quite obvious he was planning to do this it s like wow the dude who ran the fucking nazi sight was gon na shoot up somewhere who could ve fucking guessed so many people could have been and could be saved if the government actually tried to get these people more and if the conservatives weren t being like oh no muh rights and shit like thata 22 yo who had yet learned how to function in a complex society decided that ideologies were a good thing and killing others was a great idea notfuture republican representativeshowed up to club q realized it was the wrong qremovedwow this is beyond shocking its important to express your views to a freindly audiencenanthe threat needs to be or you can not roll on the tracksdeletedtheir profit last year was billion they profit over 10 million a day they could do nothing for 5 months and it would cost them a days profits https70k a day is a business expense to companies like norfolk southern and is practically a slap on the wrist this needs to be higheris it just me or does fining a dollar company seem kinda lacklustre not sure about an alternative punishment but fining them seems to do very little to deter adverse behaviour edit spelling mistakenorfolk southern income per day in 2022 was 13 million i think they can handle that 70k daily fine70k a day is 25 million dollars a year they will happily pay 25 million a year forever rather than deal with this this is not a punishment70k for 365 days 25 million norfolk southern annual revenue billion of annual revenue if they did nothing for a yearwith a fee like that they wo clean shit up our government is a jokethat is just a minute s pay for their executives shouldn t it be some 7 million a day or something and not tax deductiblens is still responsible for clean up costs and if they do pay the epa can sue for recovery of the costs epa spends in place of them the 70k is just one part of what will be a large amount of money that they out of pocket and i hope they hit for every dollar possible maybe cutting those labor costs will look less attractive going forwardspoiler alert they wo and it will not be enforced it just words for pr remind me in 2 yearsthere s been a concern by citizens very understandably that the railroad started got the tracks back on and started running and the soil under the tracks had not been dealt with dewine said so under the administrator s order that soil will be removed so the tracks will have to be taken up and that soil will have to be what do you mean you fixed the rail you supposed to clean the areaneeds more zeros on the end otherwise it just a fee that legitimizes their business practicestwo things 1 the epa is saying that they can find them up to a day which means if they fine them at all it could be much less than 2 is a rounding error for a company that pulls in billion annuallyhow is 70k per day going to do anything to a train companysounds like a lot of money to us peasants but to them its pocket changethrow a few more zeros in and change can to will and you got my attention this is just a feel good headline without any real teethwho gets the money though the epa the lawyers i doubt the victims will get itthis be buried at the bottom but everyone talking about how 70k per day is nothing which is true but how many people would they have to be paying some multiple of 70k per year to prevent such an accident 300 500 i think that what so frustrating about this the lawyers on retainer the cleanup costs the fines they all amount to what could been salaries for people to prevent such an accidentthey can go days until they lose 1 billion of their annual 35 billion in or 39 yearsa good reasom why we need to finr companies based on a of profit for a spwcified time period and not specific finesnarrarator but they didi mean it can will it almost certainly not basically all us regulatory agencies all the way up to mayor pete the secretary of transportation is completely regulatory captured only the high profile of this case has the epa making noises like they can still do something worthwhile in the current state of affairs also as is already being discussed elsewhere here 70 grand a day is a rounding error for that companylet s keep following this i would love to see the epa show actual teeth million in direct financial assistance to families and a 1 million community assistance fund is not close to enough considering the spread and they in concert are trying to spin clean up efforts as a benefit it is insulting to the human lives they have impacted and the suffering of citizens eta from their own website atlanta jan 25 2023 norfolk southern corporation nyse nsc today announced fourth quarter and 2022 financial results the company marked fourth quarter and annual records for railway operating revenue and income from railway operations fourth quarter railway operating revenue was billion up 13 and income from railway operations was billion up 5 in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022 norfolk southern made significant progress in our financial performance service improvement and engagement with our craft team members said norfolk southern president and chief executive officer alan shaw our team delivered percentage growth in revenue as well as earnings per share and achieved record revenue and operating income for the year we also outlined a bold new strategic plan to create shareholder value and a pathway for future growth for norfolk southernpennies on the dollar fucking man up epaimo that s too little considering this is possibly the worst corporate caused ecological disaster since the bp oil spill in the gulfthey think we re they really think we are that stupid to see 70k and think that s a big number 70k a day is less than a million every two weeks for these how many millions are they making by the day they are laughing at us while they watch our children drink the chemical oil slick that used to be water i can t buy a house for 70k why are they even allowed to buy away our children s health and futurehow much are they paying residents for their future medical billsthis is not enough the company made billions they would challenge it in courts and it will take years to settle a fine of million is nothing at all hell they could tell the epa to go pound sand and there is nothing they could do about it without a court orderfines should have begun the day of derailment and been escalated numerous times by now that is the only thing these corporations respond toadd two zeroes and they might care as it is that s barely a rounding errormake fines a of revenue this is the only way to be fair and stop this shitand pay for medical care if people affectedthey should already be getting finedthey could find them 70k every day for a year and it would eat up about of the profit they made last year1 let fines stack up 2 declare bankruptcy 3 get government bailout 4 give ceo 400 millioncan they fine the politicians for each time they said it was perfectly tooso about 25 million a year for a company that made billion last year that showthey are paying their lawyers more than 70k a dayso they can make the government clean it up for 70 grand a day seems like a pretty sweet deal for them they are worth 50 billion 70 grand a day is absolutely nothing to themnorfolk southern net worth is billion so even if they never made another dime they could pay that much for the next 2000 yearsshould be 70 million a day if they want the company to take them seriouslyadd at least one more zero a day is just the cost of doing business make it hurt70 thousand ladies and gentlemen do i hear 700 700 thousand per diemit s not enough to fine norfolk their books must be monitored for the next thirty years to ensure that it is the ceos and stockholders that eat the cleanup costs not those doing business with them it also must be ensured that employee jobs wages and benefits are not cut in any wayhow about 10 million dollars a dayas enormous and amount as this sounds to a regular person that is even 1 of their annual net income for 2021 it practically a rounding error70k seems pretty cheap half that amount is typical liquidated damages for construction projects i work on and that s for loss of potential business due to exceeding scheduled completion considering the environmental economical and local impact that fine should be much higher just mya cheap price for the lives of millionslol imagine if companies were fined with percentages instead of some shit static numberthat a remarkably cheap fine for the amount of damage they done now if there no cap on that and it applies for decades it still pretty cheapliquidate the whole damn companyit can fine and only man this fucking countrytaking bets on the government holding a company accountable whatever odds you wantthat it just a day do you think a dollar train company is going to care that 25 million a year if you can get it to stick and you can be damn sure they going to challenge it in court even if it does do you think they going to care about paying 25 million when they can continue to be lax on regulations and rake in 100 million a year for doing so ffs if we going to treat corporations like people then charge them with counts of reckless endangerment and send the execs to prison for 250 years otherwise fines like this are just ssing into the windit s a pittance and i m certain they won t follow through anyway corporations politicians and government agencies rarely pay for their crimesis this the same epa whose director was just toasting to the fully safe and clean drinking water in east palestinein case anyone is interested norfolk has offered to give a whopping of their profit from last year to help alleviate this they ruin the environment for an entire community and they offer penniesoh fuck that there needs to be actual consequences one way or anotheri dunno i think if i was the ceo of norfolk and i was a bad person i just say cool who do i make the cheque out to the penalties need to be much highernorfolk southern makes 12 billion http 25 20increase 20revenue 20per 20unit a year they could be finee 70k every day for a year and it would cost of how much they pay for stock buybacks httpcalculating x 364 days money company is worth 4 percent really sad day for the people of ohioi guess i should be surprised at the federal government not holding these corporations to accountthat s a fucking joke we all getting fucked greed greed greedlmao 70k per day for them is like me being fined 1 saltine cracker per day25m per year ain t making ns do jack shit you could spend that much quicker doing the actual clean up the solution to pollution is dilution the solution to crime is wasting timecan and will are two separate thingswith what norfolk southern just paid out to shareholders it could pay these daily fines for 293½ yearsfines are not enough there needs to be a criminal negligence investigation because this shit will just keep on happening drag the suits and ties into court and see how quick shit changesnot enough we need to start making penalties income based especially for companies your company causes a train wreck you fined the cost of the cleanup plus 25 of your corporate profits each day until everything is cleaned upfines are just a fee rich people and companies pay to do whatever they wanta slap on the wrist while everyone else suffers how original they not even tryingso it costs each day to ignore this cool cool cool coolthen then norfolk will pass it on to the government agency responsible for certifying the safety of the train tracks and containersdoes 70k cover the daily cost of fresh water and medical supplies for the residentscan the fines be used to fund future healthcare for those who may have breathed in toxic shitlet s say it s 1 year of the assed cleanup million companies revenue in 22 was about billion these corrupt companies similar to big pharma don t give a fuc about having to pay 25million to keep their billion profits rolling in big pharma will sell a drug making 10 billion then it comes back years later it does immeasurable harm to the people that their payed drug dealers prescribed it too so having a settlement for a million etc ain t shit they still will run their trains in that time so they fkn won they made their money these lifeless capitalist companies need to be held accountable for their negligence practically evil actions people s should matter a little fkn more then just the bottom line it s nauseating even thinking about just how great while also absolutely evil capitalism can make a company norfolksouthern offered each person from the near neighborhoods 1000 as compensation just have to sign a paper stating they received the money another interview where a family was approached by norfolksouthern employees to check their water for some of the ya kno guaranteed future cancer chemicals but they had to sign a paper at the bottom was some sort of clause saying they couldn t sue down the road something along those lines but don t hold me too exactly what it was the governor reached out to the norfolk southern they said oh sorry we didn t actually mean to give her that paper to mistake we ll update our rail industries look like something out of the 50s while checking out say japans they had around derailments all of last year wild guess how many we had last year dozen since jan 23 i guess upgrading the hiring full staff of workers requires down time aka no sales extra money to invest thats gunna be a no go bc it will not help their bottom lines now i guess i wonder what trillion dollar companies own these freight lines say maybe the media corporations that decided this wasn t important enough to investigate report on right away maybe some politicians toocan will is more important better done than saidis pathetic i ve worked on hundreds of construction projects with liquidated damages that far exceed this daily fine ns should be forced to pay at minimumthis fine amount is absolutely useless and will have no impact on the company at all norfolk southern made billion in 2021 and billion in 2022 you have to fine them 70000 a day for more than 350 years just to wipe out the last two years profits why do we only hold poor people accountable in the usacan is the important word there instead of pointing out that ability without making use of it the epa should maybe make use of some of its powers because words are cheap actions are what matter and certain actions should always have consequences or they risk being normalized as having no consequencethey could sustain a 70k fine per day for days with the in earnings they just paid out it s nonsense 7m a day is better 70m a day is even betterthey reported profit of 12b last year this is nothingjust two days ago didn t they say the air and water was safecost of doing businessneeds to be 700000 and charged hourlyarrest the executives fines for the rich are not punishment they are a cost of doing business that gets written off for a lower tax burdenit can fine them but it doesn t mean they willthe threat needs to be or executives will start serving jail timeit does even matter because they never be able to clean it up and the fight over the fines will obscure that fact for yearsconsidering paying for the clean up would be far more expensive i sure ns is quite happy to hear thisfine them a billion dollars a weekbut but should the socialistic epa be dissolved as we do need it responsible businesses would do any polluting right100 days is only 7 million paltryhow does this help the people living therethere a max fine from the epa for these normally ten million dollars i worked on an environmental crew for a pupeline installation and we would gave to go meet up to the inspectors every day to make sure they were happy with how everything was being done right down to counting fish in a slsry riverbed every day when we had a major even where we a bore got stuck in a body of water and we had to dig down and tear it out they hit the max fine amount and the inspectors demeanor completely changed they stopped asking for all tbe precautions they had demanded to save the environment before and said do whatever you want just get it donehows that fine working for the cyber ninjas and the arizona election review was 412 days ago so a simple fine of growing every day they filed for bankruptcy ai nobody paying any fines rinse and repeat herethis sounds decent but think about it mathematically norfolk southern has a revenue of what 9 billion dollars the cost of 70k over 10 days is 700k and the cost over 100 days is 7 million dollars in the course of a year you have about 21 million dollars that a pittance compared to their yearly revenue its not going to hurt them in the long runa day a year when clean up can cost billions its like they are paying them not to cleantheir annual net income for 2022 was if this fine was applied for the entire year of 2022 their annual net income for 2022 would be that s nothing to them doesn t affect how they conduct business doesn t affect how they operate it is just a cheap cheap cost of doing business70k a day seem like rounding error for this multi billion dollar company maybe try 700k a day norfolk had a revenue of billion usd in 2022 that s a 1 billion a month a day is only of their monthly earring a month of fine is only of their monthly earning not even a half percent dent to put that in context let s say you make 5000 a month fine a day is only 35 that s about the cost of lunch and dinner eating outunfortunately it would take 187 years of daily fines to wipe out the profits they made last year alone this means nothing to themns is looking to buy track in cincinnati for billion even if it takes them a year to clean up 25 million is a slap on the wrist for a company doing billion dollar dealsoh okay so in about three hundred years they have paid an equivalent amount of damagesat that rate it would take them about 39 years to be fined a full 1billionnorfolk southern just got another tax of 70k a day what does 25 million really mean to a billion dollar company of revenuethis is such a horseshit fake punishment fine them 10 of their gross income per day if they fall short so something other than nothing changesbillion in profits in 2022 they can pay per day for days that s 187 years on 1 year s profitsoh sweet so they only have to fine them for 65000 days in a row to eliminate a single year of profits what a fucking jokebut the management team keeps their bonuses right phew raises for everyone in managementso you telling me it only going to take them 188 years of consecutively charging that fee to still not be at a loss for 2022 that must be rough for themwith last years profit of billion or million per day this fine of outta teach them a lesson for sureusing last year profits alone they can pay this fine every day for 313 yearshalf of congress has money in vanguard which is largest owner of norfolk southern follow the money and you ll see why the response has been so mutedsure we can fine them anything we want as many days as we want and then when they utterly fail to pay their bills we can give it all right back to them in the form of a bailout to prevent a vital industry from going underhow about 70k per day per capita i doubt even half the fees are even levied its smoke and mirrorsthat is a laughable fine it like fining me what i pay for lunch at my jobthis is a fine of or of their incomenorfolk southern cfo like 70000 365 11 billion dollars annual revenue ffsnorfolk southern had a net profit of billion last year a day is nothing this is just the price of doing business to themhow did the exxon valdez cleanup go looks like it still out there after 3 billion dollars spent 500 million in punitive awards before their lawyers said enough was enough70k a day is an insultingly low value compared to the damage caused and continuingthat is 100 worth it for norfolk to not clean it up add 2 more zeroes at least and then they wo laugh at it look at their revenue against this fine peanutscan fine not absolutely will fine this should bankrupt that companyohio s governor said it s absurd there is no legal requirement that requires norfolk southern to notify officials that a train with hazardous materials will travel through the state there is something fundamentally wrong when a train like this could come into a state and the current law does not require despite what they were hauling does not require them to notify the state or local officials dewine said dewine is starting to sound like some kind of democratthese fine s need some inflationbut how much of that would go to those affected by the incidentand that why republicans and their idiot voters want the epa shut downcheaper to just take care of your employeesa reminder x 365 days meaning they do literally nothing for a year is just north of 25 million they profited billion in 2021 and billion in 2022 they could do nothing for 172 years and have spent only one year profits fucking ridiculous70k a day for a company that makes 35 million a day of a percent they had revenues of over billion last year they would be better off charging them a 1 cleanup taxand what will this actually do for the people that live therecan t wait to hear why republicans think they shouldn t be punishednorfolk southern would pay a day to not have to clean it up and keep on operating they net far more and spending less time manpower and material on cleaning it would certainly lessen the impact anywaythe fines should be higher they might just roll these fines into their accounting as a business expense and do nothing otherwisefor perspective this is similar to someone who makes 20 an hour 40 hours a week having to pay a dayneed to fine the ceo and board of directors each the samethey already got 25k sheesh greedy fuckersmake it a day and you might see some movementliterally pennies that is nothing to a company like norfolk southern the owner could personally keep that up out of pocket for months the epa should be levying worse against the company for what has already happened was there really no immediate fine or other form of repercussion for the palestine derailmentthat roughly double what the ceo of that company gets in total compensation on a day rate basis that is fuck allgovernment you an asshole i hate you clean that mess up or you get a fine of corp noooo please do fine me so horrifically much my business is going to tumble down alright now gim me a little million and i wo mention it ever again corp ooooooh no we are fined so much we have to layoff sooooo many employees to make up for it cough now take your little million and get lost you little leech cough cough government cough thank you cough due to unforseen circumstances and the urgency of the matter we have to clean it up ourselves and off course it will be you the little taxpayers who are gon na cough up the money it is that bad anyways you very very nice people should be proud to make sure your homes are safe something something bootstraps something something you are true proud americans and i love you and god too and god bless you society has become something in which i believe this scenario is more likely to happen than them cleaning it up or they just wait until it too latesounds like a lot but they made in profit of billion last yrit could but it woif the epa is on their ass it s probably really bad my environmental engineering professor was not a fan of them a couple years agohow does this help the affected residentsat these prices they can write it off as the price of doing business the best hope is a class action lawsuit and many many individual lawsuits after the class actiongreat to know epa administrator michael regan appointed by biden does seem like the type to let them get away with iti wish epa did something like that to ford in the sludge dumping in jersey look up ramapaugh vs ford just terriblehow about a million an hourcost of those breaks 2bn or about 2 weeks worth of annual profit they decided not to do it cost of stock buyback 200bn that was what they decided to do instead they need to be fined the cost of the buyback plus cleanup it often cheaper to pay the fine when damage is caused than to prevent it making the fine and whatever regulation that goes with it uselessthat doesn t seem like enoughdo or do not there is no canfor the norfolk southern had profits of billion last year x 365 so if they do nothing for a year they will lose or of their profits this fine is as good as letting them off for freenorfolk southern makes billion https 20norfolk 20southern 20profits 20aren 20billion 20on 20that 20basis each year in profit fining them a day for a whole year would only cost them of their profit not revenue each year the real penalty needs to be removing them from the rail system entirely or breaking them up into smaller competing entitiesoh wow that teach them norfolk southern made 3bn last year they could take that daily fine for 117 years before it exhausts their current earnings what a jokeso do it and use the money to create a fund that pays out to those affected these idle threats are pointless and these governing agencies need to figure out how to put their foot down to protect peoplei don t think i would notice if my bank took a penny out of my account every day eithersomething tells me we going to need more than dollars to clean this up maybe a would do the trickoh good a bit of napkin math they will go broke in the brief period of yearstow it outside the environmentthen they ignore the fines and put somebody that looks the other way in charge more effective would be to say that company can no longer do business in this state until all cheques are signed and disaster remediatedthat s it what about another 1k per day to each household and let s backdate this to when they were supposed to replace the old breaking system with electronic ones fuck outta herei feel ike it can and it will are two different statementsis anyone going to be shocked if they don t get fined at allwhats sad is that that sum of money may just be a slap on a wrist for some companiesthat s not a punishment it s just cost of businessthey might notice that in 35 yearswhen a disaster of this proportion occurs the government should immediately freeze all their assets and then begin using that money to clean up the mess this would be a huge deterrent towards this happening in the futurelmao they spent 200 billion on stock buybacks a day is nothing for themsuddenly norfolk southern is bankrupt and can t paythis fine is nothing nothing to this company you mean after 1000 days they will only be fined 70 million that s just 5 of their profits for the yearthat is horse shit threaten to take away their ability to make money and see how they reactoh no not 70k a literally chump changewe wo epa added but we canpin money this is a parking ticket for a 60 billion companyit can seems like an empty threat i m sure if they could they would ve alreadycan we fine joe biden for stepping in and forcing the rail workers who warned us this would happen back to workit can but wo and that money will go to get distributed and wo be used to complete rectify the situationbig difference between can and willwhat a joke of a fine 70k a day 365 days a year is in change ns made last year that like fining someone making 45k a year 90 or someone making 100k a year 200 barely a noticeable cost of doing business5 citations and you re looking at a violationepa says you can wreck anything as long as you pay the fines ns says yeah those are less than it would cost to properly maintain and safely run the trains good deali guess doing the rail car brake maintenance and track inspections was important after all exactly how much did they save by not doing required maintenance who allowed them to operate a railway without proper safety inspectionsit could put people in prison fines are cost of business and stops nothingoh no norfolk made 2b in 2020 billion with a b profitfines wo do anything especially when they as low as 70k norfolk southern should be shut down outright seize all the assets and form a new public institutionthat about sounds like the cost of doing business to mefines need to be at minimum greater than the cost of what you screwed up you commit a financial crime you should have to pay more than you gained you damage someone else property you should have to pay more than the cost of totally replacing it you caused someone to have medical bills you should have to pay more than the cost of totally covering those medical bills at minimumnorfolk said they cleaned up epa probably when they never fine thempocket change price of doing business i doubt any fine even gets imposed bp oil spillrough math 25 million for a year just of the top of my head no calculator still nowhere near punitive enough for an ounce of prevention not to do it in the first fucking place just a line item on a balance sheet as a cost of doing businessthat a paltry sum of million a year what a dealfuck the fines we need public executionneed add another zero onto thatour elected officials need to stop with the kid gloves treatment ceos need to start paying the consequences and going to prison record profits greatly reduced what when norfolksouth made last year and were outperforming that number this year charge them 7m a day and we all know they would fix it with record efficiencyneeds to be give 70k to each affected person s per day maybe per day is a bit overzealous per month though give help to the people fuck over the corporationadd a zero or two and make it matterbut trump got burgers so we gooddon t worry i m sure the supreme court will do some bs soon to strip even more of the epa s power away so big companies don t have to worry about things like this in the futurethat 25 million dollars a year they made over 4 billion dollar last year they do care if they have to pay of their yearly profit that a joke of a penaltythey might have as well charged them 70 dollars this is nothinglets say norfolk southern just does wants to pay and clean anyway and this continues for 4 more years 365 4 they make orders of magnitude more than that in profits every year at least sue them for a percentage of their profits is something but not nearly enough for them to even feel itnot severe enough put the company on the executioners blockjust fucking do it alreadyepa says it can fine norfolk southern a day if it falls short of cleaning up if it should have been fining them a day immediately until the is donenorfolk southerns 2022 reported profit of billion will last for almost days or over 115 years paying for these fines i don t think the company is worried about the finecan is a different operator word than willtheyll probably just pay fines they could ignore this for 40 years and it still only be a billion not that a billion is a small amount but it is to themthat about 25 million a year that like my yearly netflix subscription to them unless officials have the threat of jail time it may be cheaper to pay the fines then cleaning it up for the long termthey could change that to 7 million a day and they still be making 3 million in profits every single daythe railroad reported profit of 790 million or per share as volume slipped 1 that s up from 760 million or per share a year earlier ap news at per day that covers days we got them right where we want themare getting mad about the number not being big enough they said can not willi think 70k a day won t even pay for ns printer ink expenses a real fine is freezing ns retained equity and dividend for all fiscal years the cleanup is still in progressso million per year but norfolk southern has a net worth of billion this is nothing to them it would take 2 millennia for them to run out of money assuming that they were capable of earning any income including return on investments how about 7 million per day and they ca ship anything until it allthey probably okay to pay that for the foreseeable future this is laughable i have higher liquidated damages on my construction projectsso as close to zero dollars as makes no odds kthe threat needs to be or we nationalize your company norfolk southern made billion in profit last year they could afford to pay this fine for 187 years and still be less than last years profits not even factoring in the time value of moneyadd an extra 0 on there and see if they get it done 10x fasternansame as when the us left afghanistan instant takeover by the bad guys and regression to the bronze
